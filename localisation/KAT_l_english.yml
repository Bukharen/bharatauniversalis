#Missions
 kat_jethwas_title: "Conquer the Jethwas"
 kat_jethwas_desc: "The Jethwas of Porbandar are an inconvenience at most. Not only do they threaten our regional trade but they oppose us and have the audacity to call themselves our rivals. We can no longer allow this absurdity, as we must expand before the sultans of Ahmadabad surround us."
 kat_jhalavad_title: "Conquer Jhalavad"
 kat_jhalavad_desc: "Surrounded on many sides by larger, more powerful neighbors, the Rajputs of Jhalavad are in a precarious situation. If we do not manage to take these lands over in time, the Gujaratis to their north and east will strike."
 kat_army_title: "Rajput Armies"
 kat_army_desc: "As a Rajput state, armies are of great significance in our society. For this reason, it is ludicrous that our armies are as small as they are. Moreover, with many weaker states neighboring us and a looming threat in the Gujarati sultanate, it is in our best interests to assemble and maintain an army as large as possible."
 kat_sindh_title: "The Inferior Rajputs"
 kat_sindh_desc: "All this time, the Sindhis were committing blasphemy whilst we were too weak to do anything. Now that we are capable of defeating nations the like of Gujarat, it is possible for us to stop the madness in Sindh."
 kat_palitana_title: "Subjugate Palitana"
 kat_palitana_desc: "Although Palitana was once an ally and brother of ours, they are now oppose and rival us. Whilst this may put us in jeopardy seeing as they directly border the Gujarati sultanate, it is imperative that we acquire this land before the sultans come knocking at our doorstep."
 kat_attack_gujarat_title: "Tackle the Gujarati Threat"
 kat_attack_gujarat_desc: "Now that we have united the majority of Saurashtra under our rule, it is time for us to address the looming threat of Gujarat. We are no longer weak and feeble and with the help of their rivals, we can manage to defeat the sultanate."
 kat_defeat_gujarat_title: "Defeat Gujarat"
 kat_defeat_gujarat_desc: "Finally, our worst fears shall be quelled. No longer shall Gujarat be a threatening sultanate but simply a weak nation, with little-to-no chance of ever troubling us again."
 kat_mewar_title: "Betray Mewar"
 kat_mewar_desc: "Although we once had diplomatic ties to the Sisodiyas, the time has come for us to conquer Mewar. We no longer have any use for them, and they simply are in the way of potential conquests in Nagaur and the fertile Doab."
 kat_navy_title: "Expand the Navy"
 kat_navy_desc: "Trade makes up a significant portion of our economy. However, our navy is currently lacking and are quite small. Let us expand our navy and become a regional naval power."
 kat_trade_title: "Dominate Local Trade"
 kat_trade_desc: "With our heavy reliance on trade, the more shares and power, the better. As this is true, we should strive to become the dominant trade power in our home region so our nation shall prosper even more."
 kat_alliances_title: "Rajput Diplomacy"
 kat_alliances_desc: "Sooner or later, we will come face to face with the Gujarati sultans, and eventually we will meet them on the battlefield. However, our strength alone is not nearly enough to combat them. If the enemy of your enemy is your friend, then we should form an alliance with Gujarat's rivals, preferrably the Sisodiya Rajputs."
 kat_malwa_title: "Expand into Malwa"
 kat_malwa_desc: "Deeper into Central India we find yet another troublesome sultanate - this time the Malvi. With our strength acquired from defeating Gujarat, we may now have the power to topple this sultanate that threatens our dynasty."
 kat_finisher_title: "A Saurashtran Power"
 kat_finisher_desc: "The time has come to proclaim ourselves a new nation. No longer are we a petty princedom nestled within Saurashtra. We are now a growing kingdom, with domains ranging from Sindh to the Gondi Jungles. We can now proclaim ourselves a new state."
 kat_junagadh_title: "Seize Girnar"
 kat_junagadh_desc: "Mount Girnar is a holy site for Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists. Currently, it is controlled by the Chudasama dynasty, our sworn enemies. We can not allow for such an important site to be in enemy hands for any longer."  
 kat_islam_title: "Follow the Samma"
 kat_islam_desc: "Both the Jadeja Rajput dynasty and its senior branch, the Samma, have a long history of Islamic influences. Whilst the Samma have converted to Islam, our royal family has maintained its Hindu-Muslim syncretism. However, with the steady conversion of the subcontinent to Islam, it may be in our interest to follow suit."

#Events
 events_kat.1.tt: "Conversion to Islam?"
 events_kat.1.dd: "For generations, our royal family of Jadeja Rajputs has maintained a syncretic Hindu-Islamic religion. However, with steady rate of converts to Islam in our country and our senior branch, the Samma, already having converted, perhaps it is time to fully embrace Islam."
 events_kat.1.a: "Conversion to Islam will bring us closer to other sultanates."
 events_kat.1.b: "We simply cannot abandon our ancestral roots."
 events_kat.2.tt: "The Branches of Islam"
 events_kat.2.dd:  "Islam, like Hinduism, is incredibly diverse and a clear division between two main branches, Sunni and Shia, are present. In the subcontinent, there are mostly Sunni sultanates, with Shia ones only present in the Deccan. Which branch should we embrace?"
 events_kat.2.a: "Sunni is common among our merchants and can bring us closer to our neighbors."
 events_kat.2.b: "Embracing Shiism will bring us closer to the Deccan."

#Modifiers
 kat_converting: "Conversion of the Populace"

 KAT_ideas_bonus: "Devotion to Ashapura Mata"
 KAT_diaspora: "The Kutchi Diaspora"

 KAT_chandravanshi_desc: "The Jadeja clan traces back to the Lunar Dynasty of Krishna. This gives us great prestige and legitimacy in our right to own our homelands."
 KAT_syncretism: "Hindu-Muslim Syncretism"
 KAT_syncretism_desc: "Whilst our senior branch, the Samma, converted to Islam, the Jadejas kept our half-Hindu, half-Muslim syncretism. This has allowed us to be more accepting of all the faiths in our realm."
 KAT_agriculture: "Expand the Agriculture Sector"
 KAT_agriculture_desc: "Besides trade, agriculture has been one of the leading sources of income for our nation. With our growing population and our ever-expanding size, we should expand our agriculture to feed our people and fund our expansion."

 KAT_trade: "Arabian Trade"

 KAT_standardize_kutchi: "Standardize the Kutchi Language"
 KAT_standardize_kutchi_desc: "The Samma Rajputs, our senior branch, speak Sindhi. Some traders in our nation speak Gujarati, Arabic, and Persian. But Kutchi remains a language only spoken by some. We shall change this by standardizing the Kutchi language and make it known in all our courts what it is that we speak."
