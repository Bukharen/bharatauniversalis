 JFN_palk_strait: "The Palk Strait"
 JFN_palk_strait_desc: "The Palk Strait seperates Jaffna from Ramanathapuram in Tamilakam. Since it is faster to go through the straits then to go around Sri Lanka, many boats pass through this strait to travel to places like Bengal or Hormuz. We should take advantage of our great location."
 JFN_peninsular_navies: "Navies of the Jaffna Peninsula"
 JFN_peninsular_navies_desc: "The core of our land is located on a peninsula connected to the mainland of Sri Lanka by a narrow strip.

 JSL_heartland_thar_desc: "The vast Thar desert spreads froms Sindh to the west and south all throughout Rajasthan up until around Lahore. Right in the center of this desert is our fine nation, making the most of what we can. It has always been hard for invaders to trespass into our territory thanks to this harsh desert."
 JSL_jain_traditions: "Rooted Jain Traditions"
 JSL_jain_traditions_desc: "The city of Jaisalmer has always been a hub of Jainism, and they have contributed tremendously to our city.

Moreover, multiple ancient libraries of cultural and religious significance still stand to this day.

Moreover, it contains many temples that venerate the 16th and 23 tirthankaras of Jainism and the ancient libraries are filled with historical artifacts and icons. Tanot is also of importance but the least so, with some religious value. Ludarva has been like our second capital and every year, hundreds, if not thousands of Jain pilgrims flock to it."
 JSL_three_jauhars: "The Three Jauhars"
 JSL_three_jauhars_desc: "Throughout our history, there have been three major jauhars that are a token of our harsh past.\nThe first of the jauhars was in 1294. After a harsh, extended 8 year siege on Jaisalmer Fort by Delhian armies led by Alauddin Khilji, 24,000 woman committed jauhar, or ritual suicide, to avoid being captured and sold as slaves or concubines.\nAfter a royal prince raided a Delhian camp and stole his prized steed, Firuz Shah Tugluq sought revenge and laid siege to Jaisalmer Fort. In this unforgettable moment, 16,000 women, the king, his prince, and 1,700 warriors lost their lives.\nThe most horrific of the jauhars was the last, which occured in the late 15th century. An Afghan chieftain by the name of Amir Ali took it upon himself to attack our Jaisalmer Fort and with no time to light the grand fire, Rawal Lunakaran slaughtered the women in order to save them. Since there was no pyre, it is not referred to as a full jauhar, but instead a half one. The most tragic fact, however, is that the Rajputs had preemptively commited to this jauhar when they believed they were fighting a losing battle, and that the Rajputs eventually won—with Amir Ali being defeated and dying of a cannonball—meaning that the women died in vain. We can not forget our grievous past and instead we must act in order to prevent this from ever occuring again."
 JSL_never_forget: "The Perilous Delhian Siege"
 JSL_never_forget_desc: "After a grand Bhati raid on a Delhian camp, Alauddin Khalji, provoked, brought an army and besieged Jaisalmer Fort. Our noble king then decided to send the elderly, sick, and children into a safe refuge in the desert in order to protect them as the warriors expected a fight to the death. For 8 and maybe even 9 long, treacherous years we stood our ground against the vile sultanate until they finally breached our walls and overrun the fort. Attempting to avoid capture, 24,000 woman died, whether it be by jauhar or voluntarily at the hands of their relatives. Most tragically of all, the remaining men walked out and accepted their death. After this, Jaisalmer was an abandoned, barren wasteland for years."

 KND_kandy_city: "Senkadagalapura"
 KND_kandy_city_desc: "For most of Lankan history, Kandy, also known as Senkadagalapura, was one of the largest cities on the island, only rivaled by Kotte and Jaffna.

 KND_central_lankan_trade_desc: "Our great and prosperous capital has been a center of trade in Lanka for centuries.

 KND_kodithuwakkuwa: "Kodhithuwakkuwa"
 KND_kodithuwakkuwa_desc: "In the 18th century, the traditional bows and arrows of Kandyan combat became obsolete because of European muskets and artillery. As European technology reached our island, blacksmiths began improving these European weapons, allowing for better range and accuracy. From this, we developed kodhithuwakkuwa, a hand-held cannon. This will allow for us to mass produce artillery similar to the scale of European great powers."
 KND_the_last_independent_lankans: "The Last Independent Lankans"
 KND_the_last_independent_lankans_desc: "From our inception, Kandyans were fierce fighters and strived to maintain their independence.
