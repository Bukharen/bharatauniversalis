 BEI_idea_1: "Advantages of the Sea"
 BEI_idea_1_desc: "Surrounding Brunei and the island of Borneo are seas, rich in economic activity, while the interior of Borneo is dense and consists of almost inhospitable jungles, inhabited sparsely by the Dayak people. As it is almost impossible to control interior of Borneo given the thalassocratic status of our state, is only logical for us to focus on the economic advantages of seafaring and trade. "

Actions must be taken to counter and defend against their rise or we may find ourselves subjugated. "
 BEI_idea_6: "Succession in Check"
 BEI_idea_6_desc: "With the delicate politics in our region and Southeast Asia as a whole, and with many competing players such as the Suluans and Europeans each wanting to expand their footprint, it is essential to avoid internal strifes and to shore up and resolve any succession issues. Other states will inevitably want to take advantage of and fill any the power vacuum in the region."
 BEI_idea_7: "Hold Firm Against Imperialism"
 BEI_idea_7_desc: "As Europeans develop better techologies to not only improve links between the Orient and Europe but to also find ways to treat diseases such as malaria that had previously been a barrier to conquest beyond a few major coastal cities, their ability to expand their empires in the name of imperialism have dramatically increased. We must stay alert and protect ourselves in the case of an invasion or take-over attempt. "

 JSL_three_jauhars: "The Three Jauhars"
 JSL_three_jauhars_desc: "Throughout our history, there have been three major jauhars that are a token of our harsh past.\nThe first of the jauhars was in 1294. After a harsh, extended 8 year siege on Jaisalmer Fort by Delhian armies led by Alauddin Khilji, 24,000 woman committed jauhar, or ritual suicide, to avoid being captured and sold as slaves or concubines.\nAfter a royal prince raided a Delhian camp and stole his prized steed, Firuz Shah Tugluq sought revenge and laid siege to Jaisalmer Fort. In this unforgettable moment, 16,000 women, the king, his prince, and 1,700 warriors lost their lives.\nThe most horrific of the jauhars was the last, which occured in the late 15th century. An Afghan chieftain by the name of Amir Ali took it upon himself to attack our Jaisalmer Fort and with no time to light the grand fire, Rawal Lunakaran slaughtered the women in order to save them. Since there was no pyre, it is not referred to as a full jauhar, but instead a half one. The most tragic fact, however, is that the Rajputs had preemptively commited to this jauhar when they believed they were fighting a losing battle, and that the Rajputs eventually won—with Amir Ali being defeated and dying of a cannonball—meaning that the women died in vain. We can not forget our grievous past and instead we must act in order to prevent this from ever occuring again."
 JSL_never_forget: "The Perilous Delhian Siege"
 JSL_never_forget_desc: "After a grand Bhati raid on a Delhian camp, Alauddin Khalji, provoked, brought an army and besieged Jaisalmer Fort. Our noble king then decided to send the elderly, sick, and children into a safe refuge in the desert in order to protect them as the warriors expected a fight to the death. For almost nine long, treacherous years we stood our ground against the vile sultanate until they finally breached our walls and overrun the fort. Attempting to avoid capture, 24,000 woman died, whether it be by jauhar or voluntarily at the hands of their relatives. Most tragically of all, the remaining men walked out and accepted their death. After this, Jaisalmer was an abandoned, barren wasteland for years."

This will allow for us to mass produce finely-made artillery similar to the scale of European great powers."

 KND_logistical_reforms_desc: "Because of a lack of a national army, we have often relied on peasant levies to fight for our nation. However, there is one main flaw with them; their supply lines are limited and they are forced to retreat so they can resupply. During war, our armies constantly are forced to retreat in order to restock supplies and this has contributed to the inability of our nation to continously control lands during war. This is why we should institute logistical reforms in the army and prevent unnecessary retreats."

However, there was one major fault of his during his reign that would reshape our nation forever—he decreed that on his death, the kingdom of Kathmandu would be divided amongst his many sons, and on his death, his will was enforced.

There is not an official language set in stone and many people do not speak the language of our court.

However, due to the many significant differences between Chinese and Korean, many were illiterate because learning Chinese proved a struggle. Possibly with the help of the Hall of Worthies, the great Sejong invented a new writing system, easy enough that 'a wise man can acquaint himself with them before the morning is over; even a stupid man can learn them in the space of ten days.'

A significant portion of the pagodas have been reclaimed by the earth, others looted by unrighteous fools who seek to use the building materials for themselves. Worst of all, Bagan has been snatched from our hands time and time again, and it is possible this may happen again soon. By turning Pyay into a city with more splendor than Bagan could ever have, we can secure our control over a city of pagodas and reverse the consequences of the fall of Bagan."

 BPR_forty_years_desc: "The Fourty Years' War was a long-lasting conflict between the Mon Hanthawaddy Pegu and the Burmese Ava, which gave it another reputation as the Mon-Burmese War. The war begun as Ava invaded Pegu during a time of political turmoil, as Ava intended to restore the lands of Bagan that it had a dynastic claim to. Even after decades of conflict, a stalemate was reached; though it could be considered a victory for the Mon as they managed to preserve their independence and Ava failed to reclaim their ancestral lands.\n\n Pyay was a major battleground during this war, as was Arakan and Kale. The war is long over, and Pyay has recovered from the devastation it caused. Nevertheless, the military traditions established during those years have stuck, and these tactics have made our armies stronger than ever."

Through our dynastic ties, we have been able to increase our influence in the court to alarming rates. This is all whist the preoccupied rulers of Ava fail to realize our schemes, more busy with the frequent assassinations of their rulers and the rebellions that rebellions that ravage their country in the aftermath of the death.

Even during the era of Bagan—albeit their last years of survival—princes of the royal family were appointed as governors and held sway over Pyay. With the many assassinations that ensued in the 15th century, more and more governors of Pyay became king as their fathers mysteriously died, whether it be by their hand or another. The last prince to be subject to Avan tyranny was a governor, one who successfully rebelled, cemented a power base in Pyay and founded our humble kingdom. With our history of being governors, we are skilled in the most effective tactics, making us more efficient at maintaining our burgeoning state."
 BPR_avan_rebel: "Rebellion and Secession"
 BPR_avan_rebel_desc: "The story of our king Thado Minsaw and how he managed to take advantage of the situation and how he declared an independent Prome is a long yet fascinating tale. This is how the story went:\n\n Min Ba Saw was the seventh child of Narapati I and his chief queen. Surprisingly, he was initially appointed as governor of Tharrawaddy, a border town on the fringes of the Avan kingdom, whilst a brother was in charge of Pyay. For over a decade, he remained at this post. But change was coming; his father had died and his elder brother succeeded to the throne as Thihathura I. Using the help of one of his older brothers, he rose up in arms, but was forced to submit to his brother, who foolishly forgave him and restored his position.\n\n However, with the death of his brother less than a decade later, a war among brothers emerged as Min Ba Saw's nephew, the governor of Yamethin, rebelled against his recently-coronated brother, Minkhaung II. The cunning Min Ba Saw saw an opportunity and managed to seize Pyay, establishing the independent state of Prome and proclaiming himself king Thado Minsaw. Resisting the king's attempts to recover Pyay for decades, Prome was able to remain independent for almost a century.\n\n The story of our successful rebellion of Prome from the oppression of Ava is an icon of our nationalism and is a source of morale for the people. The almost-legendary story will be part of our oral history for centuries to come."
