 BEI_idea_1_desc: "Surrounding Brunei and the island of Borneo are seas, rich in economic activity, while the interior of Borneo is dense and consists of almost inhospitable jungles, inhabited sparsely by the Dayak people. As it is almost impossible to control interior of Borneo given the thalassocratic status of our state, is only logical for us to focus on the economic advantages of seafaring and trade. "

 BEI_idea_4: "Diplomatic Balance with Europeans"
 BEI_idea_4_desc: "With the arrival of many powerful European states, each having superior naval and land strength, we must be carefully balance our trade and economic interests with the security and survival of our state.

Actions must be taken to counter and defend against their rise or we may find ourselves subjugated. "
 BEI_idea_6: "Succession in Check"
 BEI_idea_6_desc: "With the delicate politics in our region and Southeast Asia as a whole, and with many competing players such as the Suluans and Europeans each wanting to expand their footprint, it is essential to avoid internal strifes and to shore up and resolve any succession issues. Other states will inevitably want to take advantage of and fill any the power vacuum in the region."
 BEI_idea_7: "Hold Firm Against Imperialism"
 BEI_idea_7_desc: "As Europeans develop better technologies to not only improve links between the Orient and Europe but to also find ways to treat diseases such as malaria that had previously been a barrier to conquest beyond a few major coastal cities, their ability to expand their empires in the name of imperialism have dramatically increased. We must stay alert and protect ourselves in the case of an invasion or take-over attempt. "

 JFN_palk_strait: "The Palk Strait"
 JFN_palk_strait_desc: "The Palk Strait seperates Jaffna from Ramanathapuram in Tamilakam. Since it is faster to go through the straits then to go around Sri Lanka, many boats pass through this strait to travel to places like Bengal or Hormuz. We should take advantage of our great location."

 JFN_peninsular_navies_desc: "The core of our land is located on a peninsula connected to the mainland of Sri Lanka by a narrow strip.

 JSL_heartland_thar_desc: "The vast Thar desert spreads froms Sindh to the west and south all throughout Rajasthan up until around Lahore. Right in the center of this desert is our fine nation, making the most of what we can. It has always been hard for invaders to trespass into our territory thanks to this harsh desert."
 JSL_jain_traditions: "Rooted Jain Traditions"
 JSL_jain_traditions_desc: "The city of Jaisalmer has always been a hub of Jainism, and they have contributed tremendously to our city. Many of our sumptuous temples in veneration of the 16th and 23th tirthankaras have been contributed by them and they are a major factor in the economy. Moreover, multiple ancient libraries of cultural and religious significance still stand to this day. Also, our cities of Ludarva and Pokhran are also pilgrimage sites filled with historical artifacts and every year, an influx of yatri arive for pilgrimage."

Moreover, it contains many temples that venerate the 16th and 23 tirthankaras of Jainism and the ancient libraries are filled with historical artifacts and icons. Tanot is also of importance but the least so, with some religious value. Ludarva has been like our second capital and every year, hundreds, if not thousands of Jain pilgrims flock to it."
 JSL_three_jauhars: "The Three Jauhars"
 JSL_three_jauhars_desc: "Throughout our history, there have been three major jauhars that are a token of our harsh past.\nThe first of the jauhars was in 1294. After a harsh, extended 8 year siege on Jaisalmer Fort by Delhian armies led by Alauddin Khilji, 24,000 woman committed jauhar, or ritual suicide, to avoid being captured and sold as slaves or concubines.\nAfter a royal prince raided a Delhian camp and stole his prized steed, Firuz Shah Tugluq sought revenge and laid siege to Jaisalmer Fort. In this unforgettable moment, 16,000 women, the king, his prince, and 1,700 warriors lost their lives.\nThe most horrific of the jauhars was the last, which occured in the late 15th century. An Afghan chieftain by the name of Amir Ali took it upon himself to attack our Jaisalmer Fort and with no time to light the grand fire, Rawal Lunakaran slaughtered the women in order to save them. Since there was no pyre, it is not referred to as a full jauhar, but instead a half one. The most tragic fact, however, is that the Rajputs had preemptively commited to this jauhar when they believed they were fighting a losing battle, and that the Rajputs eventually won—with Amir Ali being defeated and dying of a cannonball—meaning that the women died in vain. We can not forget our grievous past and instead we must act in order to prevent this from ever occuring again."
 JSL_never_forget: "The Perilous Delhian Siege"
 JSL_never_forget_desc: "After a grand Bhati raid on a Delhian camp, Alauddin Khalji, provoked, brought an army and besieged Jaisalmer Fort. Our noble king then decided to send the elderly, sick, and children into a safe refuge in the desert in order to protect them as the warriors expected a fight to the death. For 8 and maybe even 9 long, treacherous years we stood our ground against the vile sultanate until they finally breached our walls and overrun the fort. Attempting to avoid capture, 24,000 woman died, whether it be by jauhar or voluntarily at the hands of their relatives. Most tragically of all, the remaining men walked out and accepted their death. After this, Jaisalmer was an abandoned, barren wasteland for years."

 KND_senkadagalapura_desc: "For most of Lankan history, Kandy, also known as Senkadagalapura, was one of the largest cities on the island, only rivaled by Kotte and Nallur. However, something that sets us apart is the religious significance of our city to Theravada Buddhism. Thousands from across East and Southeast Asia flock to Kandy every year, and some of our visitors could help improve our nation if utilized well."

 KND_frescoes_desc: "Our court has always been an illustrious center of art and literature.  Thanks to this, the advent of Kandyan frescoes—articulate mural paintings—has gained traction and new forms of art continue to emerge. Because of literacy often being limited to the educated and nobility, murals have been promoted by monks as a way to spread Buddhism to the populace, as art is a quintessential concept. The various themes of these frescoes potray an extensive range of topics, from the Buddha himself to victories of our nation."
 KND_kodithuwakkuwa: "Kodhithuwakkuwa"
 KND_kodithuwakkuwa_desc: "In the 18th century, the traditional bows and arrows of Kandyan combat became obsolete because of European muskets and artillery. As European technology reached our island, blacksmiths began improving these European weapons, allowing for better range and accuracy. From this, we developed kodhithuwakkuwa, a hand-held cannon. This will allow for us to mass produce artillery similar to the scale of European great powers."
 KND_logistical_reforms: "Institute Logistical Reforms"
 KND_logistical_reforms_desc: "Because of a lack of a national army, we have often relied on peasant levies to fight for our nation. However, there is one main flaw with them; their supply lines are limited and they are forced to retreat so they can resupply. During war, our armies constantly are forced to retreat in order to restock supplies and this has contributed to the inability of our nation to continously control lands during war. This is why we should institute logistical reforms in the army and prevent unnecessary retreats."
 KND_iron_industry: "Cultivate the Iron Industry"

 KMT_hajo_pilgrimage: "Control of Hajo"
 KMT_hajo_pilgrimage_desc: "To both Hindus and Muslims all across our lands, Hajo is of significant value.
