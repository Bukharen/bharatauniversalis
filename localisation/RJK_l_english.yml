 rjk_independence_title: "Achieve Independence"
 rjk_independence_desc: "For generations upon generations, we have been subservient to Kutch and subject to oppression from our overlords. No longer shall we be subject to this treachery. We will achieve our independence and proclaim ourselves as a new nation!"
 rjk_junagadh_title: "Subdue Girnar"
 rjk_junagadh_desc: "The Chudasama Rajputs to our south have placed their court in close proximity to the holy Mount Girnar. With the prestigious outlook on a nation in control of such a significant holy site, we should seek to seize Mount Girnar for ourselves and elevate our status and become exalted among others."  
 rjk_jethwas_title: "Seize Porbandar"
 rjk_jethwas_desc: "The key port of Porbandar on the coast of the Saurashtrian coast has been under Jethwa rule for centuries. Since most of our core is locked in the central, landlocked part of Saurashtra, our naval and trade ambitions may never come to fruition. We should change this by seizing the port and establishing maritime trade."
 rjk_jhalavad_title: "Conquer Jhalavad"
 rjk_jhalavad_desc: "The small princedom of Jhalavad lives in a precarious state, with a constant threat of Gujarati invasion. Sooner or later, we expect the Gujarati to strike and attempt to extend their reach even farther into Saurashtra. We cannot allow for them to grow any stronger, or our newly achieved independence will be at stake. Clearly, we should strike first and prevent any Gujarati incursions into our homeland."
 rjk_army_title: "Rajput Armies"
 rjk_army_desc: "With our Rajput warrior culture dominating our way of life, it is extremely counterintuitive and simply ludicrous that our armies are this disorganized. As a Rajput state, armies are of great significance in our society and are no laughing matter. With many weaker states neighboring us and a looming threat in the Gujarati sultanate, it is in our best interests to assemble an army as large as possible."
 rjk_kutch_title: "Turn the Tables"
 rjk_kutch_desc: "Once our former overlords, the land of Kutch week and feeble since our secession from their realm. They also share a long border with Gujarati sultanate which they has had numerous scuffles with and with their relatives, the Samma, in the north. Moreover, the royal family, the Jadejas, have always adhered to a heathenous syncretism between Hinduism and Islam, which is simply intolerable. It has also come to our attention that the Great Rann of Kutch has harsh terrain and would be a strategically defendable location in battle. We must turn the tables on our former overlords and subdue all of Kutch. They shall reign for no longer!"
 rjk_sindh_title: "Heart of the Indus"
 rjk_sindh_desc: "The mighty Indus river, the backbone of the fertile farmlands of Punjab and a river that has prevented many empires from advancing further, is completely ruled over by heathens. Centuries ago, the Samma Rajputs of Sindh had converted to Islam and has proselytized the people of Sindh away from the true faith. No longer shall we tolerate their blasphemous actions. It is time we eliminate the Samma Rajputs, stop this madness, and bring the Sindhi back to the true faith."
 rjk_palitana_title: "Subjugate Palitana"
 rjk_palitana_desc: "Once a major center of Jain religion and trade, Palitana has been reduced to a small princely state ruled by the Gohils who face invasion from the Gujarati sultanate. If we wish to unite Saurashtra and block any further Gujarati advances, Palitana is a crucial hub of trade which would allow us to dominate Saurashtrian trade even more."
 rjk_attack_gujarat_title: "Tackle the Gujarati Threat"
 rjk_attack_gujarat_desc: "Now that we have united the majority of Saurashtra under our rule, it is time for us to address the looming threat of Gujarat. We are no longer weak and feeble and with the help of their rivals, we can manage to defeat the sultanate."
 rjk_defeat_gujarat_title: "End Gujarati Supremacy"
 rjk_defeat_gujarat_desc: "Since its inception, the Gujarati sultanate has dominated our homeland in the Saurashtrian peninsula and has threatened our independence. This shall last for no longer. We must rise to arms, seize Ahmadabad, and end the Gujarati domination in Saurashtra once and for all!"
 rjk_mewar_title: "Betray Mewar"
 rjk_mewar_desc: "The Sisodiyas have always been our friends in battle and have helped us tremendously over the years. Nevertheless, we no longer have any use for them and they instead are simply in the way of further expansion into the fertile Doab. We must abandon our former allies and subjugate them so that we may continue our expansion into Rajputana."
 rjk_navy_title: "A Rajput Navy"
 rjk_navy_desc: "As we find ourselves no longer landlocked, we have been opened to the lucrative Arabian Sea trade. However, our lack of ships still limits us as we have few trade ships to exercise. Therefore, if we wish to expand our role in the Arabian sea trade, it is imperative we construct a grand navy to do so."
 rjk_trade_title: "Gujarati Trade Hegemony"
 rjk_trade_desc: "Thanks to our location on a peninsula jutting into the Arabian Sea, our Rajput warrior culture has developed into a mercantile one as well with a heavy reliance on trade. However, we currently hold miniscule shares within the lucrative Arabian Sea enterprise and are locked from the vast sums of wealth that this trade yields. If we truly want to become a prosperous society with a balance between military and maritime might, we must dominate the regional trade in Gujarat so that we may later extend our reach even farther beyond."
 rjk_alliances_title: "Rajput Diplomacy"
 rjk_alliances_desc: "As a recently established state, we are in dire need of diplomatic alliances if we wish to remain independent. Moreover, sooner or later we will inevitably have to come face to face with the Gujarati sultans, and eventually we will meet them on the battlefield. However, our military strength pales in comparison to theirs and we are in no shape to combat them alone. Seeing as the enemy of your enemy is your friend, we should establish diplomatic relations with the enemies of Gujarat."
 rjk_malwa_title: "Expand into Malwa"
 rjk_malwa_desc: "For centuries now, our continent has been plagued by sultanates that have established themselves taking advantage of the power gap left by the decline of the Delhian sultanate. Whilst we have managed to subdue the Gujarati sultanate, not far away deeper into the Deccan we find yet another troublesome sultanate—this time the Malvi. With our strength acquired from defeating Gujarat and our trusty allies, however, we may now have the power to topple this sultanate that threatens our dynasty."
 rjk_finisher_title: "From Humble Beginnings"
 rjk_finisher_desc: "Just some years ago, we were a vulnerable petty princedom that had recently declared independence from Kutch. From these humble beginnings, we have conquered swathes of land and can proclaim ourselves a new nation—the kingdom of the Saurashtrans. "
 rjk_islam_title: "Follow the Sindhi"
 rjk_islam_desc: "Both the Jadeja Rajput dynasty and its senior branch, the Samma, have a long history of Islamic influences. Whilst the Samma have fully embraced Islam, our royal family has maintained its Hindu-Muslim syncretism. With the steady conversion of the subcontinent to Islam and the influx of Arab and Muslim merchants, perhaps it may be in our interest to follow suit."
