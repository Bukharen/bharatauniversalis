 ptl_army_title: "Rajput Armies"
 ptl_army_desc: "As a Rajput state, armies are of great significance in our society. For this reason, it is ludicrous that our armies are as small as they are. Moreover, with many weaker states neighboring us and a looming threat in the Gujarati sultanate, it is in our best interests to assemble and maintain an army as large as possible."
 ptl_kutch_title: "Annex Kutch"
 ptl_kutch_desc: "The Jadejas of Kutch are threatened by the Gujarati sultanate. Many conflicts have arisen between the two and Kutch is constantly threatened by them. It has also come to our attention that Kutch has easily defendable terrain and would be a much more preferrable location for battle.

 ptl_alliances_title: "Rajput Diplomacy"
 ptl_alliances_desc: "Sooner or later, we will come face to face with the Gujarati sultans, and eventually we will meet them on the battlefield.
