 ori_jharkhand_title: "Into Jharkhand"
 ori_jharkhand_desc: "Jharkhand straddles across the borders of three growing powers in India. This puts that a precarious position, in that anyone who invades will become closer to the other two.

 ori_gaur_title: "Onward to Gauda"
 ori_gaur_desc: "Gauda is the prized center of the once-greater Bengali crown, but since they have lost to us Gauda has had less power over the region. Nevertheless, it is still a great conquest, and thus we should expand our reach to Gauda." 
 ori_arakan_title: "Seize the Arakani Coast"

 ori_culture_desc: "As we expand more and more, the Oriya culture becomes a minority in our territory.

 ori_bidar_desc: "Finally, after years of conquest and war, we close in near Bidar, the prized city of the Bahmanids. By now, they are but a shadow of their former self, no longer being able to rival Orissa at all. Let us take Bidar and quell the Bahmani flame once and for all!"

 ori_three_capitals_desc: "Three great cities, Bidar, Vijayanagar, and Gauda, lie in our hands, each once a capital of a great nation. But now, the only great nation is Orissa, and Orissa only. What are we to do with these three cities that rival our capital? Let us choose."
