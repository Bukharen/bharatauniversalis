 ori_garjati_fealty_desc: "Inland from the Oriya coast, we have multiple vassals in Garjat, Jeypore, Parlakhimidi, and Keonjhar. However, maintaining so many vassals is tedious and tiresome. With our king's many sons, we could unite them and put a son as head."
 ori_cultural_acceptance_title: "Cultural Acceptance"

Therefore, we should annex this region to extend our reach and block off the Bahmanids."
 ori_jharkhand_title: "Into Jharkhand"
 ori_jharkhand_desc: "Jharkhand straddles across the borders of three growing powers in India. This puts that a precarious position, in that anyone who invades will become closer to the other two.

 ori_andamans_desc: "Not far from Orissa or Bengal lies the Andaman Islands. Relatively isolated and aggressive to invaders, nobody has attempted to colonize the usland yet. However, with its central location between Bengal and Sumatra, it could be a great docking point and a way to better supply our Indonesian conquests."
 ori_elephants_title: "Oriya Elephants"
 ori_elephants_desc: "In Oriya, Gajapati means 'master of the elephants.' Therefore, it is unfitting that we do not comprise our army of at least 33% cavalry. We should seek to fix this, and add cavalry to our armies."
 ori_mallabhum_title: "Subjugate Mallabhum"

 ori_bengal_title: "Bengali Expansion"
 ori_bengal_desc: "Right next to our border is the troublesome fort of Satgaon, which Bengal maintains in order to hold us off. With our strength, however, the Bengali are mere weaklings. We should expand into Bengal and acquire this fort as a means of expanding Bengali trade and extending our reach."
 ori_gaur_title: "Onward to Gauda"
 ori_gaur_desc: "Gauda is the prized center of the once-greater Bengali crown, but since they have lost to us Gauda has had less power over the region. Nevertheless, it is still a great conquest, and thus we should expand our reach to Gauda." 
 ori_arakan_title: "Seize the Arakani Coast"

 ori_culture_title: "Spread Oriya Culture"
 ori_culture_desc: "As we expand more and more, the Oriya culture becomes a minority in our territory. Sooner or later, Oriya culture will become obsolete as more and more of our land comprises of Bengali, Telugu, or Gond-Garjat people.

 ori_oriya_title: "A Growing Culture"
 ori_oriya_desc: "With our intentions of teaching people the ways of the Oriya crown, people have learned to accept our culture and turn it into their own. Once we educate a sizable amount of people, then we will know that Oriya culture shall flourish henceforth."

 ori_bidar_title: "Advance to Bidar"
 ori_bidar_desc: "Finally, after years of conquest and war, we close in near Bidar, the prized city of the Bahmanids. By now, they are but a shadow of their former self, no longer being able to rival Orissa at all. Let us take Bidar and quell the Bahmani flame once and for all!"
 ori_three_capitals_title: "The Three Capitals"
 ori_three_capitals_desc: "Three great cities, Bidar, Vijayanagar, and Gauda, lie in our hands, each once a capital of a great nation. But now, the only great nation is Orissa, and Orissa only. What are we to do with these three cities that rival our capital? Let us choose." 
 ori_pegu_title: "Hanthawaddy Pegu"
 ori_pegu_desc: "The Hanthawaddy River Delta is rich in resources and even richer in trade. The only real threat to our empire in Indian Ocean trade. The fact that they threaten our trade is intolerable, and so we must conquer Lower Burma to gain complete control of Indian Ocean trade."

 ori_jagannath_desc: "Jagannath is a reincarnation of Vishnu, and one of the primary celebrated deities of our crown. However, since our land is very diverse, the people practice whatever they want. We should seek to build temples and spread our beliefs throughout our lands."
 ori_education_title: "Educating the Population"
 ori_education_desc: "Our population is very uneducated and this has caused us to lack behind in technology compared to the more advanced Europeans. We can change this, however, by promoting the building of universities and potentially changing our education system."

 ori_andhra_desc: "The Reddi Nayaks of Rajahmundry have the audacity to ally our enemies and claim to rival our state.

#Events
 events_ori.1.tt: "The Velama Revolt"
 events_ori.1.dd: "Between 1424 and 1425, Ahmad Shah Al Wali, the then-current sultan of the Bahmani sultanate, launched an expeditionary force into Telingana with the intent of subjugating the independent Velama Nayaks. Throughout this, hundreds of thousands of Telugu civillians were massacred and the major centers of culture like Devarakonda and Warangal were razed to the ground. Since then, the autonomous Velama chiefs have been subservient to Bahmani treachery and have been forced to be subject to their oppression and violation of their nation and people. However, fed up with this, the Nayaks have decided to openly rebel against their overlords and seek to rid foreign rule. They have approached us with an offer: if we were to help them, they would willingly become our subject as long as we defend them. Whilst this is a convenient offer seeing as we would like to expand into the Deccan anyways, it will risk a war with the Bahmani sultanate. Are we prepared for that?"
 events_ori.1.a: "No longer shall we tolerate sultanate supremacism."
 events_ori.1.b: "We can not afford war." 
 events_ori.2.tt: "Orissa backs the Velama Nayaks"
 events_ori.2.dd: "The Oriya crown has decided to back the Velama chiefs in their revolt. This alone could be a declaration of war, but can we afford a war against Orissa and the Velamas?"
 events_ori.2.a: "This means war." 
 events_ori.2.b: "Let the Velama chiefs free."
 events_ori.3.tt: "Bahmanis declares war!"
 events_ori.3.dd: "In retaliation for our support of their rebellion, the Bahmanids have declared war on us!"
 events_ori.3.a: "Concerning."
 events_ori.4.tt: "Bahmanis backs down."
 events_ori.4.dd: "After hearing news of our support of the rebels, the Bahmanids have backed down and Telingana has accepted vassalage under our crown."
 events_ori.4.a: "Great!"
 events_ori.5.tt: "The Fate of Gauda"
 events_ori.5.dd: "With humble beginnings as a city built by the almost legendary Shashanka, Gauda has proven itself an exceptional administrative center for all those who control it. Starting with the Gauda kingdom with Shashanka, it has come under Pala, Delhian, and Bengali control. The Delhians themselves realized the effectiveness of Gauda and it became the provincial capital of their Bengali domain. Later on, Nasiruddin Mahmud Shah, the sultan of Bengal, sought to relocate his capital to Gauda noticing its strategic position over Pandua, the former capital, after the meandering rivers of the Delta suddenly began to change course.\nSince then, the city has swelled into a grand metropolis rivaling the great cities of Vijayanagar, and even Nanjing and the Forbidden City all the way in the populous China. Thanks to its rich history and its reputation of being a capital of all those that are Bengali, it is now said that those who control Gauda are destined to become the ruler of all of Bengal. Located in the heart of Bengal, the illustrious city of Gauda is a marvelous city to be in control of and the prestige in owning it can make any nation exalted among others. Now that it is in our hands, we can choose to exercise our power by looting the city or we can—knowing its pivotal role—opt to instead keep it intact so that we may one day utilize it as a provincial capital that can aid us in administrating our Bengali conquests."
 events_ori.5.a: "Loot the city."
 events_ori.5.b: "Demolish the fort."
 events_ori.5.c: "Raze it to the ground!"
 events_ori.5.d: "It would be more ideal to keep it as a provincial capital."
 events_ori.6.tt: "Respecting Local Deities"
 events_ori.6.dd: "The supreme deity that our crown follows is Jagannath. However, most of our people adhere to local traditions and regional deities. Should we force them to pray to Jagannath, or allow them freedom of choice?"
 events_ori.6.a: "Jagannath, and Jagannath only."
 events_ori.6.b: "Allow freedom of choice."
 events_ori.7.tt: "Oriya Education"
 events_ori.7.dd: "For the longest time, Vedic education has been taught to the growing population. However, as we come into contact with Europeans, we find that their technology has become more advanced than ours. We can start to teach Western education in schools, or we can continue with our traditional Vedic education."
 events_ori.7.a: "Western education will help us become technologically advanced."
 events_ori.7.b: "Vedic education better suits our personal ideals."
 events_ori.8.tt: "The Four Capitals"
 events_ori.8.dd: "Four of the greatest centers of culture in all of the subcontinent are in our hands; Gauda, Bidar, Cuttack, and Vijayanagar.\nVijayanagar, literally meaning the City of Victory, has been a bastion of Hindu revivalism and Kannada culture since the Vijayanagari pushed the Muslim sultanates out of Tamilakam. After the collapse of the Hoysala kingdom at the hands of the Tughluq sultanate, Rayalaseema was left in a power vacuum as the succeeding Kampili kingdom was razed to the ground after the Delhians came back for more. Thanks to this, however, the Vijayanagari could rapidly expand and take advantage of the internal instability of the Delhian sultanate as many governors began to secede from the sultanate and establish their own. With their capital at this City of Victory, Vijayanagar has become a urban hub of the pre-Islamic Hindu culture and traditions after centuries of Muslim domination. \nCuttack his been our seat of power since Kapilendra deemed it so. Since the 10th century, Cuttack has been a capital of the Oriya, having previously been the capital of the Keshari and Eastern Ganga dynasties. Most recently, in 1434, as the Eastern Ganga met their demise and Kapilendra conquered this dying dynasty, he sought to establish it as his own capital as a central location from which his empire could administer the lands he went on and conquered in just the span of 20 years. \nBidar has also been a historical capital for many centuries. Starting with the Chalukyas when it was referred to as Kalyana, it has been a capital of many kingdoms and sultanates over the years, them most recent of which being the Bahmanids, who construct hundreds of mosques and madrasas and even have the audacity to call it Muhammadabad. Now that it has been taken from them, however, we can begin the revival of Hinduism in the Deccan as well. \nLast but certainly not least, is Gauda. Also known as Gaur, Gauda has been the capital of the Bengal sultanate since the 1450s and has a history from as far ago as the Mahajanadapada era. Once the capital of the Sena, namesake Gauda, Pala, and the aforementioned Bengali sultanate, it has been an influential metropolis since the 6th century. After ages of sultanate rule since the Delhians conquered it in the 13th century, it has been relinquished from foreign occupants by our great nation.\nClearly with all of these great cities under our control, we have realized that perhaps they are more strategic centers to administrate our rapidly growing empire from. Whilst Cuttack has been an optimal capital for so long, it is no longer central and proves dysfunctional in maintaining this large of an empire. With Bidar being at an extremely central position in the Deccan, Vijayangar not far south and a center of culture and religion, and Gauda being centered in the heart of Bengal, perhaps it is time to move our capital."
 events_ori.8.a: "Restore Bidar as Viduranagar."
 events_ori.8.b: "Restore Vijayanagar as Hampi."
 events_ori.8.c: "Restore the city of Gauda as Lakhnauti."
 events_ori.8.d: "Keep Cuttack as the capital."
 events_ori.9.tt: "End of the Civil War"
 events_ori.9.dd: "Right after the death of Kapilendra, the Gajapati state was plunged into civil war as Hamvira and Purushottama fought for the throne of Orissa. After years of this devastating war and half of our land ravaged, it has finally ended as the great [Root.Monarch.GetName] has restabilized our nation and eliminated all pretenders from claiming the throne henceforth."
 events_ori.9.a: "Splendid!"
 events_ori.10.tt: "Hamvira's Demands"
 events_ori.10.dd: "After the death of Kapilendra, Hamvira fled to the south where he amassed an army and began his march up north. Since then, his army has besieged and occupied most of our lands south of our capital. Now, he has finally revealed his demands. This will require that Purushottama abdicate the throne and allow Hamvira to usurp and become our ruler."
 events_ori.10.a: "Reject his outlandish demands."
 events_ori.10.b: "Accept."
 events_ori.11.tt: "Kapilendra changes his Heir"
 events_ori.11.dd: "Our heir, Hamvira, has proven himself as truly a son of Kapilendra with his military genius. He has managed to expand on two fronts against the Rajahmundry Reddis and also the Bengalis to the north. However, all this time, Purushottama, the youngest son and the product of Kapilendra's philandering and a lowly concubine, has steadily increased his influence in the court in Puri. So much so, in fact, that Kapilendra has decided to designate Purushottama as the new heir."
 events_ori.11.a: "This will surely anger Hamvira."
