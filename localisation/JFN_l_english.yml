 jfn_palk_strait_desc: "With both Ramanathapuram and Nallur under our control, the Palk Strait is dominated by us. However, trade in the region is lacking and many of the lands are undeveloped. This could be easily changed though, we simply have to develop our ports in Ramanathapuram."

 jfn_maldives_title: "Conquer the Maldives"

 jfn_convertmaldives_desc: "Since the mid-12th century, the Maldives have been a center of Islam in the Indian Ocean. As the protectors of the Malayalam people and Hinduism, it is intolerable that our brethren follow a different faith. Let us re-educate them in the ways of Hinduism."
