#Malayali Scholars
 events_malayalam.1.tt: "Cherusseri Namboothiri"
 events_malayalam.1.dd: "Within Kolathunad lives the great Cherusseri Namboothiri. The founder of Malayalam Gatha and the author behind both the Krishna and Bharata Gatha, he has played an influential role in the development of Malayalam literature. Perhaps it would be in the best interests of [Root.Monarch.GetName] to invite him to our court."
 events_malayalam.1.a: "He would make a great advisor."
 events_malayalam.2.tt: "Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan"
 events_malayalam.2.dd: "Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan is a man of great merit. Not only has he translated both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata into Malayalam, but he has standardised Malayalam as a whole and brought great changes for the language. Moreover, he is a great devotee of Guruvayuruppan and is also the man who told Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri to compose the work that eventually became the Narayaneeyam. We should invite this 'father of modern Malayalam' and a patron of Guruvayuruppan as soon as possible."
 events_malayalam.2.a: "Invite him to court."
 events_malayalam.3.tt: "Kunchan Nambiar"
 events_malayalam.3.dd: "Kunchan Nambiar is regarded as the last of the three great Malayali poets. However, he isn't just a poet. He's also a dancer and performer credited with creating the growing art style known as Ottamthullal. In our court, this man would be able to do great things and spread our culture and literature far beyond Kerala."
 events_malayalam.3.a: "As custodians of Malayali literature, we should invite him."
 events_malayalam.4.tt: "Poonthanam Nambudiri"
 events_malayalam.4.dd: "Kerala has always been a center of literature and advances in math and science, whether it be through the treatises of the Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics or it be the works of Cherusseri Namboothiri and Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan. Another great poet by the name of Poonthanam Nambudiri has made his mark on religious literature through his great work Jnanappana dedicated to Guruvayuruppan. With his wisdom and devotion we can make more masterpieces to show our devotion to our gods."
 events_malayalam.4.a: "Invite this man to court."
 events_malayalam.5.tt: "The Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics"
 events_malayalam.5.dd: "The Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics is one of the most prestigious and advanced schools of learning in all of India. Through great philosophers the likes of Neelakanta Somayaji, Jyesthadeva, Madhava of Sangamagrama and Parameshwara, many advances in calculus and astrology have been made. It would bring great benefit to our nation to fund this school and educate the populous."
 events_malayalam.5.a: "The efforts of these scholars will help us greatly."
 events_malayalam.5.b: "We do not have the finances to fund the school's efforts."
 events_malayalam.6.tt: "Nilakantha Somayaji"
 events_malayalam.6.dd: "The Kerala school has done it once more. Another great mathematician and astrologer has came out of their efforts. Nilakantha Somayaji or Kellalur Comatiri has made many breakthroughs in astrology and the sciences. With his advanced treatise Tantrasamgraha and the commentary Aryabhatiya Bhasya, there is no doubt what this man could do. We should bring him to our court at once."
 events_malayalam.6.a: "Bring this man to our court."
 events_malayalam.7.tt: "Jyesthadeva"
 events_malayalam.7.dd: "The great mathematicians and astrologers of Kerala have gave way to another great mind - Jyesthadeva. A disciple of Nilakantha Somayaji, Jyesthadeva's greatest work is the Yuktibhasa, a commentary on the Tantrasamgraha written by Somayaji. This man will bring us beyond the splendor of Somayaji and make our nation excel in math and science once more."
 events_malayalam.7.a: "A welcome addition to our court."
 events_malayalam.8.tt: "The Third Student"
 events_malayalam.8.dd: "Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri is the third student of the great Achyutha Pisharadi and a dedicated disciple of his. His magnum opus, the Prakriya-sarvasvam, is a commentary on the classical system made by the legendary Panini. However, he has become more renowned for his devotional text, Narayaneeyam, dedicated to none other than Guruvayuruppan. With his skill in both religious literature and sciences, perhaps we can expand our knowledge of both."
 events_malayalam.8.a: "We could use a man like Bhattathiri."
 events_malayalam.9.tt: "Death of Parameshwara"
 events_malayalam.9.dd: "Vatasseri Parameshwara Nambudiri was a major figure and the tutor of Nilakantha Somayaji. He once helped literature and philosophy flourish, but since [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s accession to the throne, he has become an aging man. We have now discovered that he died just recently."
 events_malayalam.9.a: "May he move on peacefully."
 events_malayalam.10.tt: "Achyutha Pisharadi"
 events_malayalam.10.dd: "Achyutha Pisharadi is another celebrated prodigy of Kerala. The disciple of Jyesthadeva and the tutor of many including none other than Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri, he played a large significant in the writing of the Narayaneeyam. In addition, if it wasn't for Bhattathiri's devotion to his teacher, the Narayaneeyam wouldn't have ever been written or recommended to Bhattathiri by Ezhuthachan. Besides the Narayaneeyam, however, many other great works were produced by Pisharadi. We should invite this revered talent to our court."
 events_malayalam.10.a: "He will make a great courtier."

It seems that this island had more potential than we ever expected."
 events_trade_good_changes.1.a: "Interesting, though those exiles are getting more than they deserve."
