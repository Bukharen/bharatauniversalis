 lxa_convert_shan_title: "Convert the Shan"
 lxa_convert_shan_desc: "Many of the people of the Shan Hills still follow their indigenous beliefs. But in a nation like ours, that cannot stay. We should convert the Shan and teach them the enlightened ways of Buddha." 
 lxa_capitals_title: "Imperial Centers"
 lxa_capitals_desc: "There are four main centers of Lao culture in our nation - Luang Prabang, Vientiane, Muan Phang, and Champassak. However, all of them are currently lacking and are a shell of their former selves. We should change this by restoring these cities to their former glory."
 lxa_develop_title: "The Grand Lao Road"
 lxa_develop_desc: "Along the Mekong are most of our centers of trade and commerce, including many of our historical capitals. Thus, it is in our best interest to develop these lands and promote trade there. Our advisors have recently recommended the building of the Grand Lao Road, which will revolutionize our Mekong holdings." 
 lxa_preparation_title: "Reform the Army"
 lxa_preparation_desc: "With the long borders we share with many of our rivals, it is crucial to keep the army in shape. However, the army has recently deteriorated and our country looks weaker than ever. Let us expand our army and restore our strength in Indochina."
 lxa_shan_title: "Incursions into Shan Land"
 lxa_shan_desc: "The Shan states are as disunited as the jungles of India. Each and every independent state is one area not subject to us that could be. We can not let this last any longer though, so let us conquer the Shan states."
 lxa_pegu_title: "Hanthawaddy Pegu"
 lxa_pegu_desc: "Pegu is a center of trade and of Mon culture in Burma. However, with both the Arakani pirates and the Thai at their doorstep, they are bound to be attacked eventually. Instead, we can take them for ourselves and let no other nation get access to these valuable trade centers."
 lxa_follow_irrawaddy_title: "Follow the Irrawaddy"
 lxa_follow_irrawaddy_desc: "If we follow the Irrawaddy from Pegu, we reach into the centers of Taungoo, the remnants of Bagan, and Ava lands. If it means eliminating more troublesome Saophas and also attacking the source, then we should expand into Central Burma."
 lxa_ava_title: "Center of Burma"
 lxa_ava_desc: "The center of the entirety of Burma is in Ava. At the end of the day, all of the troublesome Saophas that we once had to deal with submit to Ava. For no longer, however, as we shall conquer this beloved city and bring the Saophas to our feet instead."
 lxa_burma_united_title: "Burma United!"
 lxa_burma_united_desc: "What remains of Burma is either miniscule and obscure or under our crown's control. However, if we want to be masters of Burma, it all has to be completely under our rule."
 lxa_lanna_title: "Eliminate Lan Na"
 lxa_lanna_desc: "Lan Na under Tilokaracha has been extremely troublesome. It is astonishing how he has managed to unite so many lands in such a short amount of time and threatens even the Thai down south. However, they have never faced a nation as mighty as us, and they shall fall under us too." 
 lxa_khorat_title: "Unite Khorat"
 lxa_khorat_desc: "Whilst the majority of the Khorat region is already under our control, some settlements are still under enemy control. As we already expect to be invading the Thai soon, it is in our interest to start by uniting Khorat."
 lxa_ayutthaya_title: "Eclipse Ayutthaya"
 lxa_ayutthaya_desc: "The time has come for us to eclipse Ayutthaya. Surrounded by us in three fronts and having faced defeat by our hands before, they are weaker than ever. No longer shall the Thai threaten our crown or our people!"
 lxa_angkor_wat_title: "Restore Angkor Wat"
 lxa_angkor_wat_desc: "Angkor Wat was once a great temple and the center of the Khmer court. However, through centuries of warfare and uncontrollable flooding, the city has almost been deserted and reclaimed by the surrounding jungles. It doesn't help that it has been sacked by both the Cham and the Thai, nor that it experienced a mass emigration. Now that it is under our control, we must restore Angkor Wat to its former glory and beyond."
 lxa_xiangtaeng_title: "Annex Xiang Taeng"
 lxa_xiangtaeng_desc: "Xiang Taeng, also known as Stung Treng to the Khmer, has been a center of Lao culture in Cambodia for almost a century. Thus, it is quite unfathomable as to why it is under control of the dying empire that is the Khmer. For no longer shall we allow the Lao of Xiang Taeng to be under enemy occupation."
 lxa_mekong_title: "The Mekong Delta"
 lxa_mekong_desc: "At the tip of Cambodia is the Hindu-populated Mekong Delta, a crucial center of both trade and commerce in Indochina. The large city of Chaktomuk in the Mekong Delta was the last center of the Khmer Empire and rivals both Ha Noi and Ayutthaya in population. We should conquer these lands and expand in both trade and size."
 lxa_cavalry_title: "Utilize the Cavalry"
 lxa_cavalry_desc: "With our official name, Lan Xang Hom Khao, meaning 'Land of A Million Elephants and White Parasols', it is quite laughable that our cavalry is as lacking as it is. If we want to truly live up to our name, we have to ensure that a significant portion of our army comprises of cavalry."
 lxa_cambodia_title: "Follow the Mekong"
 lxa_cambodia_desc: "The Khmer Empire is a dying state. The remnants of what was once a great empire now struggles to survive against Thai and Cham incursions. With our conquest of Xiang Taeng, Cambodia is open and undefended against our conquests. It would not be hard to conquer what's left of Cambodia by this point."
 lxa_tonkin_title: "Around the Mountains"
 lxa_tonkin_desc: "For ages, the Tonkin area of Central Vietnam has been nearly unreachable mainly because of the Annamite mountains. However, now that we have conquered the Red River Delta, Tonkin lays open and undefended against our might. Now that we have found a solution to our problem, we can simply expand south from the core of Vietnam."
 lxa_finisher_title: "Fa Ngum's Legacy"
 lxa_finisher_desc: "Fa Ngum was the great founder of Lan Xang. He managed to fight against the odds and united the Laotian lands under his banner. As his true successors we managed to expand his kingdom into a great empire like no other. Lan Xang Hom Khao is now a great power."
 lxa_sipsongchautai_title: "Sip Song Chau Tai"
 lxa_sipsongchautai_desc: "Right across our border with Dai Viet lies the area of Sipsongchautai, filled with minor Tai tribes subjugated under Vietnamese rule. The Tai people are like our brethren, they speak a similar language and share aspects of our culture. The fact that some foreign Vietnamese invaders own these lands is intolerable, so we should save our brothers in Sipsongchautai."
 lxa_redriverdelta_title: "Advance to the Delta"
 lxa_redriverdelta_desc: "The Red River Delta of Vietnam is one of the most densely populated regions in Indochina. Full of many of our rivals' peoples and the home of the Vietnamese court, it is a prime target for eastward expansion. Perhaps if we subjugated this region we could reap significant benefits."
 lxa_champa_title: "Finish off Champa"
 lxa_champa_desc: "Like the Khmer down south, Champa is also a dying state facing annexation by an enemy state - this time the Vietnamese. Instead of giving our rivals a chance to expand, let us finish off this sad state and rid them of their misery."
 lxa_develop_songhong_title: "Develop the Delta"
 lxa_develop_songhong_desc: "The Red River Delta is fertile and has a lot of potential if handled correctly. However, many lands in the Delta are jungle and are left as is. This should be changed, as there are far more benefits of having developed cities in the delta over having useless jungle."
 lxa_mountainpasses_title: "Traversing the Mountains"
 lxa_mountainpasses_desc: "The Annamite Mountains prove hard to cross through and are troublesome as they force us to either travel through harsh terrain or go around it. However, the discovery of a new passage has allowed for faster travel. Let us promote and develop this mountain pass to increase the speed and amount of travel between Laos and Vietnam."
 
#Events
 events_lxa.1.tt: "The Four Imperial Lao Centers"
 events_lxa.1.dd: "The four main centers of Lao culture are in Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Muan Phang, and Champassak. All four are of equal size and population and vie to be the sole center of our nation. The question is, which one shall we make our capital?"
 events_lxa.1.a: "Refurbish Muan Phang and make it the capital."
 events_lxa.1.b: "Our best bet would be Champassak in our south."
 events_lxa.1.c: "Let us make it at Vientiane for it has a fort."

 events_lxa.2.tt: "Building the Grand Lao Road"
 events_lxa.2.dd: "Most of our settlements around the Mekong are large and propserous. However, they are not properly connected and travel between cities is limited.

 events_lxa.2.a: "Build it."
 events_lxa.2.b: "We do not have the facilities for it."
 events_lxa.3.tt: "The Vietnamese Issue"
 events_lxa.3.dd: "The Vietnamese people living in our nation are quite rebellious and are detrimental to the potential of Vietnam.

 events_lxa.3.a: "Like the ideals of the Great Buddha, we should be tolerant."
 events_lxa.3.b: "They are heretics and follow a barbarous culture!"

However, if we offer them vassalization, perhaps they would be willing to become our subject in order to protect their interests."
 events_lxa.4.a: "Offer them vassalization."
 events_lxa.4.b: "We can not afford so many vassals."
 events_lxa.5.tt: "Lan Xang offers Vassalization"
 events_lxa.5.dd: "Sire! News has reached our court! The warmongering conquerors of Lan Xang have sent us an offer! Instead of being ravaged by their barbarous armies, we can simply submit to their rule and face little to no repercussions. Shall we accept?"
 events_lxa.5.a: "Of course!"
 events_lxa.5.b: "We will fight until our last breaths."
 events_lxa.6.tt: "A Lao Center at Hue?"
 events_lxa.6.dd: "Hue on the Tonkin coast is a bustling entrepot and a center of trade. However, it is but a small town and has not reached its full potential. It is in our best interests to expand Hue to become a coastal center of trade and prevent Ha Noi from being too influential within our borders."
 events_lxa.6.a: "Start construction immediately."
 events_lxa.6.b: "We cannot afford to."
 events_lxa.7.tt: "Vijaya's Future"
 events_lxa.7.dd: "After conquering the impregnable fortress of Vijaya, the shining capital of Champa, it has come to our attention that the city is full of loot and gold. It may not be humane, but perhaps we can ransack the city and take the loot back to the capital."
 events_lxa.7.a: "Loot the city."
 events_lxa.7.b: "Simply ransack the fort."
 events_lxa.7.c: "Raze it to the ground!"
 events_lxa.7.d: "This is not what Buddha has taught us."
