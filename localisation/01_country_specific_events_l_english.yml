#Bikaner/Jangladesh
 events_jan.1.tt: "The Founding of Bikaner"
 events_jan.1.dd: "The vast, barren desert known as Jangladesh has long been divided among regional Jat clans vying for dominance over this sparse land. Throughout the latter half of the 1460s, however, this would change. The first son of Rao Jodha—the same Jodha as the one of Jodhpur in Marwar—sought to establish his own kingdom and traveled to the oasis of Bikaner. Rao Bika went on to take advantage of the disunited Jat clans and unite all of Jangladesh under his rule. He then founded the city of Bikaner, which he named after himself, and built Junagarh fort in 1478. Just ten years later, Bikaner state was formally established under the Rathore dynasty, controlling the lands for almost the next five centuries."
 events_jan.1.a: "A capital fit for a king!"
   
#Generic Saurashtri
 events_jgd.1.tt: "The Gujarati Court"
 events_jgd.1.dd: "The land we know now as Ahmadabad has a long rich history of pre-sultanate rule. Intially, the area was known as Ashaval, but after Chalukya king Karna annexed it near the turn of the 11th century, it was renamed to Karnavati after him. Since then, Karnavati has been a major settlement along the banks of the Sabarmati river in Gujarat and the rulers of him have commonly came to conquer the rest of Saurashtra. Nevertheless, in the 13th century, it was conquered by the Delhian sultanate as Solanki rule came to an end, ushering in centuries of Muslim rule. In 1411, Muzaffar Shah, a former Delhian governor and the first sultan of the newly established Gujarati sultanate—one of the many sultantes that seceded from the Delhian realm in the wake of the internal instability induced by the sack of Delhi by the Timurids in 1398—seized Karnavati from local rule and refashioned it as Ahmadabad, which later became the capital of the sultanate. Muzaffar Shah went on and founded the Muzaffarid dynasty, the one that is currently in power and Gujarat and the same one that has plagued us for all of this time. Ahmadabad—this capital he founded—is a lavish metropolis that seats the Muzaffarid dynasty and, the Gujarati court, and the royal palace and a city where every culture can be found, and it is now in our hands.\nAs our armies march through the city and ransack it, we realize truly how grand a city it is. There are hundreds of mosques and temples and each and every single one is embellished with sumptuous art and unfathomable quantities of gold. Now that it is in our hands, the Gujarati sultan will be more keen on accepting a surrender as his life is at stake. We can also choose to loot the city and raze it to the ground. What should we do?"
 events_jgd.1.a: "Demand their unconditional surrender."
 events_jgd.1.b: "Raze Ahmadabad to the ground!"
 events_jgd.1.c: "We need to be humane, or there will be dire consequences awaiting us."
 events_jgd.2.tt: "An Ultimatum from the Enemy"
 events_jgd.2.dd: "Our venerable capital of Ahmadabad has fell to the invading Saurashtrians. Our great, benevolent Sultan and his court are already surrounded as the enemy troops ransack the city and loot our extravagant mosques and temples. This ultimatum demands that we cede them Khambhat and Ahmadabad and accept their subserviency at once. With our nation at risk of collapsing, perhaps this is time to surrender."
 events_jgd.2.a: "It is best that we accept."
 events_jgd.2.b: "We will never bow down to weaklings!"
 events_jgd.3.tt: "The Sack of Ahmedabad"
 events_jgd.3.dd: "The great metropolis of Gujarat, the sumptuous, lavish city renowned for its splendor, is in ruins. Once a marvelous center for all to admire, the city has been reduced to all but rubble as the troops advance further and further through the city. The glorious house of our court and once the home of our great palace is demolished and all that exists is debris and the bodies of our dead men. Ahmadabad, once the mighty capital of the prosperous Gujarati sultanate, is gone."
 events_jgd.3.a: "This is an outrage!"
 events_jgd.4.tt: "Gujarat Accepts"
 events_jgd.4.dd: "Facing near capitulation as our armies have occupied most of their land, Gujarat has chosen to accept the demands of our ultimatum. This means that Ahmadabad and Khambhat will become ours, and Gujarat will accept their fate and become subservient to us."
 events_jgd.4.a: "Great."
 events_jgd.5.tt: "Gujarat Rejects Demands"
 events_jgd.5.dd: "Even whilst under great stress and at risk of capitulation, Gujarat has still foolishly chosen to reject the demands of our ultimatum."

#Khmer
 events_khm.1.tt: "Back to the Old Ways?"
 events_khm.1.dd: "Centuries ago, many conflicts arose because of the large Hindu populations and the royal family's gradual conversion to Buddhism. For example, the city of Angkor was once a grand Hindu temple, but was soon converted to a Buddhist one with the ascension of a Buddhist king to the throne. Whilst we are currently Buddhist, a sizable portion of our land is Hindu. Since both religions are deeply rooted in our culture, it is not impossible for us to maintain our Buddhist-like syncretism or even revert back to Hinduism."
 events_khm.1.a: "Let us revert back to our roots."
 events_khm.1.b: "We should retain our Buddhist beliefs."
 events_khm.2.tt: "Yasodharapura and Chaktomuk"
 events_khm.2.dd: "Yasodharapura or Angkor and Chaktomuk or Phnom Penh are but two of the historical capitals of our nation. However, both are more significant then our other historical capitals. Angkor was once a bustling metropolis like no other and both a holy center for Hindus and Buddhists alike. Phnom Penh is surrounded by fertile farmlands and could prove its worth as as the agricultural backbone for our nation, feeding millions. Perhaps we should move our capitals to one of these locations for the benefit of our nation."
 events_khm.2.a: "Move it back to Yasodharapura."
 events_khm.2.b: "Chaktomuk is at a better location."
 events_khm.2.c: "We'd be better off leaving it at Oudong."
 events_khm.3.tt: "The Sack of Ayutthaya"
 events_khm.3.dd: "Long ago, the Thai of Ayutthaya sacked our glorious capital of Angkor. But the tables have turned. We have gotten ahold of their capital, Ayutthaya. Although it may not karmically correct, we should seek vengeance for what they did to the shining jewel of our nation so many years ago."
 events_khm.3.a: "We cannot forgive what they did to our beautiful Angkor."
 events_khm.3.b: "We have to be merciful."
 events_khm.4.tt: "The Fall of Ayutthaya"
 events_khm.4.dd: "Ayutthaya, the shining jewel of our nation and the city named after which Rama himself was born, has been sacked. The Khmer have razed the city to the ground and the nobles have been slaughtered. The once great city that rivaled the centers of Burma and India is now desolate and overrun by the Khmer army."
 events_khm.4.a: "This is an outrage!"
 events_khm.5.tt: "Mon-Khmer Influence in Northern Thailand"
 events_khm.5.dd: "We have managed to topple the Thai kingdom of Lan Na in Northern Thailand. Within their borders, we have found remnants of the Mon Haripunchai state through the city of Lamphun and the Mon minorities in the region. If we potentially installed a puppet state, there would be great benefit to our nation. Not only would it help Mon and Mon-Khmer culture regrow in Northern Thailand,  but it would allow us to protect our borders from Shan and Karenni raiders by using Haripunchai as a shield."
 events_khm.5.a: "Reinstate Haripunchai as our puppet."
 events_khm.5.b: "Direct control is the way to go."

 events_cey.1.dd: "The  Aryachakravarti kings of Nallur, whilst nominally being vassals to the Vijaynagari Empire, were extremely autonomous and function more like tributaries. The relationship had been breaking steadily, and when Prince Sapumal invaded in 1450, Vijayanagar did not aid their subject and Cinkaiariyan Kanakasooriyan, the king, was ousted and only managed to seize the lands back after Sapumal left 17 years later. Jaffna would never fall to Vijayanagari supremacy again. "

 events_cey.3.dd: "The kingdom of Kotte down south has sent us an ultimatum demanding we  submit to their rule or face war with them. Now that we are not under Vijayanagari protection, we  have to defend our land from the rest of the island and are completely surrounded. What should we do?"

 events_cey.4.dd: "Lanka is in turmoil.The kingdom of Kotte, which comprises the majority of Lanka, has formally declared war and is invading our former vassal Jaffna. Whilst they are no longer diplomatically tied to us, we fear that if Kotte succeeds, they will break Lanka out of our sphere of influence."
 events_cey.4.a: "If they succeed, Lanka will leave of our sphere of influence."
 events_cey.4.b: "They are foolish for ever leaving us. They must suffer."
 events_cey.5.tt: "Jaffna Concedes"
 events_cey.5.dd: "We truly are a mighty nation. Fearing us, Jaffna has accepted our demands and has ceded all of their lands to us. This allows us to avoid conflict and the death of our men."

 events_cey.6.dd: "Jaffna has foolishly refused to agree to the demands of our ultimatum. We now have the justifications to declare war on them if we do desire."

 events_cey.11.dd: "Whilst we thought Jaffna was assimilating into our realm quite nicely, this is clearly not the case. Rebels in Jaffna led by the ousted Cinkaiariyan Kanakasooriyan Aryachakravarti have seized Nallur and are demanding to restore Jaffna as an independent state.

 events_kat.1.dd: "For generations, our royal family of Jadeja Rajputs has maintained a syncretic Hindu-Islamic religion. However, with steady rate of converts to Islam in our country and our senior branch, the Samma, already having converted, perhaps it is time to fully embrace Islam."

 events_ori.1.dd: "Between 1424 and 1425, Ahmad Shah Al Wali, the then-current sultan of the Bahmani sultanate, launched an expeditionary force into Telingana with the intent of subjugating the independent Velama Nayaks. Throughout this, hundreds of thousands of Telugu civillians were massacred and the major centers of culture like Devarakonda and Warangal were razed to the ground. Since then, the autonomous Velama chiefs have been subservient to Bahmani treachery and have been forced to be subject to their oppression and violation of their nation and people. However, fed up with this, the Nayaks have decided to openly rebel against their overlords and seek to rid foreign rule. They have approached us with an offer: if we were to help them, they would willingly become our subject as long as we defend them. Whilst this is a convenient offer seeing as we would like to expand into the Deccan anyways, it will risk a war with the Bahmani sultanate. Are we prepared for that?"

 events_ori.5.tt: "The Fate of Gauda"
 events_ori.5.dd: "With humble beginnings as a city built by the almost legendary Shashanka, Gauda has proven itself an exceptional administrative center for all those who control it. Starting with the Gauda kingdom with Shashanka, it has come under Pala, Delhian, and Bengali control. The Delhians themselves realized the effectiveness of Gauda and it became the provincial capital of their Bengali domain. Later on, Nasiruddin Mahmud Shah, the sultan of Bengal, sought to relocate his capital to Gauda noticing its strategic position over Pandua, the former capital, after the meandering rivers of the Delta suddenly began to change course.\nSince then, the city has swelled into a grand metropolis rivaling the great cities of Vijayanagar, and even Nanjing and the Forbidden City all the way in the populous China. Thanks to its rich history and its reputation of being a capital of all those that are Bengali, it is now said that those who control Gauda are destined to become the ruler of all of Bengal. Located in the heart of Bengal, the illustrious city of Gauda is a marvelous city to be in control of and the prestige in owning it can make any nation exalted among others. Now that it is in our hands, we can choose to exercise our power by looting the city or we can—knowing its pivotal role—opt to instead keep it intact so that we may one day utilize it as a provincial capital that can aid us in administrating our Bengali conquests."
 events_ori.5.a: "Loot the city."

 events_ori.7.a: "Western education will help us become technologically advanced."
 events_ori.7.b: "Vedic education better suits our personal ideals."
 events_ori.8.tt: "The Four Capitals"
 events_ori.8.dd: "Four of the greatest centers of culture in all of the subcontinent are in our hands; Gauda, Bidar, Cuttack, and Vijayanagar.\nVijayanagar, literally meaning the City of Victory, has been a bastion of Hindu revivalism and Kannada culture since the Vijayanagari pushed the Muslim sultanates out of Tamilakam. After the collapse of the Hoysala kingdom at the hands of the Tughluq sultanate, Rayalaseema was left in a power vacuum as the succeeding Kampili kingdom was razed to the ground after the Delhians came back for more. Thanks to this, however, the Vijayanagari could rapidly expand and take advantage of the internal instability of the Delhian sultanate as many governors began to secede from the sultanate and establish their own. With their capital at this City of Victory, Vijayanagar has become a urban hub of the pre-Islamic Hindu culture and traditions after centuries of Muslim domination. \nCuttack his been our seat of power since Kapilendra deemed it so. Since the 10th century, Cuttack has been a capital of the Oriya, having previously been the capital of the Keshari and Eastern Ganga dynasties. Most recently, in 1434, as the Eastern Ganga met their demise and Kapilendra conquered this dying dynasty, he sought to establish it as his own capital as a central location from which his empire could administer the lands he went on and conquered in just the span of 20 years. \nBidar has also been a historical capital for many centuries. Starting with the Chalukyas when it was referred to as Kalyana, it has been a capital of many kingdoms and sultanates over the years, them most recent of which being the Bahmanids, who construct hundreds of mosques and madrasas and even have the audacity to call it Muhammadabad. Now that it has been taken from them, however, we can begin the revival of Hinduism in the Deccan as well. \nLast but certainly not least, is Gauda. Also known as Gaur, Gauda has been the capital of the Bengal sultanate since the 1450s and has a history from as far ago as the Mahajanadapada era. Once the capital of the Sena, namesake Gauda, Pala, and the aforementioned Bengali sultanate, it has been an influential metropolis since the 6th century. After ages of sultanate rule since the Delhians conquered it in the 13th century, it has been relinquished from foreign occupants by our great nation.\nClearly with all of these great cities under our control, we have realized that perhaps they are more strategic centers to administrate our rapidly growing empire from. Whilst Cuttack has been an optimal capital for so long, it is no longer central and proves dysfunctional in maintaining this large of an empire. With Bidar being at an extremely central position in the Deccan, Vijayangar not far south and a center of culture and religion, and Gauda being centered in the heart of Bengal, perhaps it is time to move our capital."
 events_ori.8.a: "Restore Bidar as Viduranagar."
 events_ori.8.b: "Restore Vijayanagar as Hampi."
 events_ori.8.c: "Restore the city of Gauda as Lakhnauti."
 events_ori.8.d: "Keep Cuttack as the capital."
 events_ori.9.tt: "End of the Civil War"
 events_ori.9.dd: "Right after the death of Kapilendra, the Gajapati state was plunged into civil war as Hamvira and Purushottama fought for the throne of Orissa. After years of this devastating war and half of our land ravaged, it has finally ended as the great [Root.Monarch.GetName] has restabilized our nation and eliminated all pretenders from claiming the throne henceforth."
 events_ori.9.a: "Splendid!"
 events_ori.10.tt: "Hamvira's Demands"
 events_ori.10.dd: "After the death of Kapilendra, Hamvira fled to the south where he amassed an army and began his march up north. Since then, his army has besieged and occupied most of our lands south of our capital. Now, he has finally revealed his demands. This will require that Purushottama abdicate the throne and allow Hamvira to usurp and become our ruler."
 events_ori.10.a: "Reject his outlandish demands."
 events_ori.10.b: "Accept."
 events_ori.11.tt: "Kapilendra changes his Heir"
 events_ori.11.dd: "Our heir, Hamvira, has proven himself as truly a son of Kapilendra with his military genius. He has managed to expand on two fronts against the Rajahmundry Reddis and also the Bengalis to the north. However, all this time, Purushottama, the youngest son and the product of Kapilendra's philandering and a lowly concubine, has steadily increased his influence in the court in Puri. So much so, in fact, that Kapilendra has decided to designate Purushottama as the new heir."
 events_ori.11.a: "This will surely anger Hamvira."
