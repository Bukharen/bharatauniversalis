 jgd_girnar_title: "Mount Girnar"
 jgd_girnar_desc: "Situated not far from our court at Junagadh, Mount Girnar is a pilgrimage point for Hindus and Jains alike. It has come to our attention that we could be opportunistic and make a profit out of this holy site. "
 jgd_uparkot_title: "Renovate Uparkot Fort"
 jgd_uparkot_desc: "In the vicinity of our capital, Uparkot Fort gives us an advantage as it provides superior fortification to our capital. However, as it was built many centuries ago, many components have deteriorated and are not up to date. We should expand the fort and renovate it so that it can protect our core."
 jgd_jethwas_title: "Conquer the Jethwas"
 jgd_jethwas_desc: "The Jethwas of Porbandar are an inconvenience at most. Not only do they threaten our regional trade but they oppose us and have the audacity to call themselves our rivals. We can no longer allow this absurdity, as we must expand before the sultans of Ahmadabad surround us."
 jgd_jhalavad_title: "Conquer Jhalavad"
 jgd_jhalavad_desc: "Surrounded on many sides by larger, more powerful neighbors, the Rajputs of Jhalavad are in a precarious situation. If we do not manage to take these lands over in time, the Gujaratis to their north and east will strike."
 jgd_army_title: "Rajput Armies"
 jgd_army_desc: "As a Rajput state, armies are of great significance in our society. For this reason, it is ludicrous that our armies are as small as they are. Moreover, with many weaker states neighboring us and a looming threat in the Gujarati sultanate, it is in our best interests to assemble and maintain an army as large as possible."
 jgd_kutch_title: "Annex Kutch"
 jgd_kutch_desc: "The Jadejas of Kutch are threatened by the Gujarati sultanate. Many conflicts have arisen between the two and Kutch is constantly threatened by them. It has also come to our attention that Kutch has easily defendable terrain and would be a much more preferrable location for battle. Furthermore, the Kutchi ruling family is filled with syncretic heathens who do not truly follow the ideals of Hinduism. They shall reign for no longer."
 jgd_sindh_title: "Subdue the Heathens"
 jgd_sindh_desc: "All this time, the Sindhis were committing blasphemy whilst we were too weak to do anything. Now that we are capable of defeating nations the like of Gujarat, it is possible for us to stop the madness in Sindh."
 jgd_palitana_title: "Subjugate Palitana"
 jgd_palitana_desc: "Although Palitana was once an ally and brother of ours, they are now oppose and rival us. Whilst this may put us in jeopardy seeing as they directly border the Gujarati sultanate, it is imperative that we acquire this land before the sultans come knocking at our doorstep."
 jgd_attack_gujarat_title: "Tackle the Gujarati Threat"
 jgd_attack_gujarat_desc: "Now that we have united the majority of Saurashtra under our rule, it is time for us to address the looming threat of Gujarat. We are no longer weak and feeble and with the help of their rivals, we can manage to defeat the sultanate."
 jgd_defeat_gujarat_title: "Defeat Gujarat"
 jgd_defeat_gujarat_desc: "Finally, our worst fears shall be quelled. No longer shall Gujarat be a threatening sultanate but simply a weak nation, with little-to-no chance of ever troubling us again."
 jgd_mewar_title: "Betray Mewar"
 jgd_mewar_desc: "Although we once had diplomatic ties to the Sisodiyas, the time has come for us to conquer Mewar. We no longer have any use for them, and they simply are in the way of potential conquests in Nagaur and the fertile Doab."
 jgd_navy_title: "Expand the Navy"
 jgd_navy_desc: "Trade makes up a significant portion of our economy. However, our navy is currently lacking and are quite small. Let us expand our navy and become a regional naval power."
 jgd_trade_title: "Dominate Local Trade"
 jgd_trade_desc: "With our heavy reliance on trade, the more shares and power, the better. As this is true, we should strive to become the dominant trade power in our home region so our nation shall prosper even more."
 jgd_alliances_title: "Rajput Diplomacy"
 jgd_alliances_desc: "Sooner or later, we will come face to face with the Gujarati sultans, and eventually we will meet them on the battlefield. However, our strength alone is not nearly enough to combat them. If the enemy of your enemy is your friend, then we should form an alliance with Gujarat's rivals, preferrably the Sisodiya Rajputs."
 jgd_malwa_title: "Expand into Malwa"
 jgd_malwa_desc: "Deeper into Central India we find yet another troublesome sultanate - this time the Malvi. With our strength acquired from defeating Gujarat, we may now have the power to topple this sultanate that threatens our dynasty."

 jgd_finisher_desc: "The time has come to proclaim ourselves a new nation. No longer are we a petty princedom nestled within Saurashtra. We are now a growing kingdom, with domains ranging from Sindh to the Gondi Jungles. We can now proclaim ourselves a new state."
 
#Events
 events_jgd.1.tt: "The Gujarati Court"
 events_jgd.1.dd: "The land we know now as Ahmadabad has a long rich history of pre-sultanate rule. Intially, the area was known as Ashaval, but after Chalukya king Karna annexed it near the turn of the 11th century, it was renamed to Karnavati after him. Since then, Karnavati has been a major settlement along the banks of the Sabarmati river in Gujarat and the rulers of him have commonly came to conquer the rest of Saurashtra. Nevertheless, in the 13th century, it was conquered by the Delhian sultanate as Solanki rule came to an end, ushering in centuries of Muslim rule. In 1411, Muzaffar Shah, a former Delhian governor and the first sultan of the newly established Gujarati sultanate—one of the many sultantes that seceded from the Delhian realm in the wake of the internal instability induced by the sack of Delhi by the Timurids in 1398—seized Karnavati from local rule and refashioned it as Ahmadabad, which later became the capital of the sultanate. Muzaffar Shah went on and founded the Muzaffarid dynasty, the one that is currently in power and Gujarat and the same one that has plagued us for all of this time. Ahmadabad—this capital he founded—is a lavish metropolis that seats the Muzaffarid dynasty and, the Gujarati court, and the royal palace and a city where every culture can be found, and it is now in our hands.\nAs our armies march through the city and ransack it, we realize truly how grand a city it is. There are hundreds of mosques and temples and each and every single one is embellished with sumptuous art and unfathomable quantities of gold. Now that it is in our hands, the Gujarati sultan will be more keen on accepting a surrender as his life is at stake. We can also choose to loot the city and raze it to the ground. What should we do?"
 events_jgd.1.a: "Demand their unconditional surrender."
 events_jgd.1.b: "Raze Ahmadabad to the ground!"

 events_jgd.2.dd: "Our venerable capital of Ahmadabad has fell to the invading Saurashtrians. Our great, benevolent Sultan and his court are already surrounded as the enemy troops ransack the city and loot our extravagant mosques and temples. This ultimatum demands that we cede them Khambhat and Ahmadabad and accept their subserviency at once. With our nation at risk of collapsing, perhaps this is time to surrender."
 events_jgd.2.a: "It is best that we accept."
 events_jgd.2.b: "We will never bow down to weaklings!"
 events_jgd.3.tt: "The Sack of Ahmedabad"
 events_jgd.3.dd: "The great metropolis of Gujarat, the sumptuous, lavish city renowned for its splendor, is in ruins. Once a marvelous center for all to admire, the city has been reduced to all but rubble as the troops advance further and further through the city. The glorious house of our court and once the home of our great palace is demolished and all that exists is debris and the bodies of our dead men. Ahmadabad, once the mighty capital of the prosperous Gujarati sultanate, is gone."
 events_jgd.3.a: "This is an outrage!"
 events_jgd.4.tt: "Gujarat Accepts"
 events_jgd.4.dd: "Facing near capitulation as our armies have occupied most of their land, Gujarat has chosen to accept the demands of our ultimatum. This means that Ahmadabad and Khambhat will become ours, and Gujarat will accept their fate and become subservient to us."
 events_jgd.4.a: "Great."
 events_jgd.5.tt: "Gujarat Rejects Demands"
 events_jgd.5.dd: "Even whilst under great stress and at risk of capitulation, Gujarat has still foolishly chosen to reject the demands of our ultimatum."
