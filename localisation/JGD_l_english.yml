 jgd_girnar_title: "Mount Girnar"
 jgd_girnar_desc: "Situated not far from our court at Junagadh, Mount Girnar is a pilgrimage point for Hindus and Jains alike. It has come to our attention that we could be opportunistic and make a profit out of this holy site. "

 jgd_uparkot_desc: "In the vicinity of our capital, Uparkot Fort gives us an advantage as it provides superior fortification to our capital.

 jgd_jethwas_title: "Conquer the Jethwas"
 jgd_jethwas_desc: "The Jethwas of Porbandar are an inconvenience at most. Not only do they threaten our regional trade but they oppose us and have the audacity to call themselves our rivals. We can no longer allow this absurdity, as we must expand before the sultans of Ahmadabad surround us."
 jgd_jhalavad_title: "Conquer Jhalavad"
 jgd_jhalavad_desc: "Surrounded on many sides by larger, more powerful neighbors, the Rajputs of Jhalavad are in a precarious situation. If we do not manage to take these lands over in time, the Gujaratis to their north and east will strike."
 jgd_army_title: "Rajput Armies"
 jgd_army_desc: "As a Rajput state, armies are of great significance in our society. For this reason, it is ludicrous that our armies are as small as they are.

 jgd_kutch_title: "Annex Kutch"
 jgd_kutch_desc: "The Jadejas of Kutch are threatened by the Gujarati sultanate. Many conflicts have arisen between the two and Kutch is constantly threatened by them. It has also come to our attention that Kutch has easily defendable terrain and would be a much more preferrable location for battle. Furthermore, the Kutchi ruling family is filled with syncretic heathens who do not truly follow the ideals of Hinduism. They shall reign for no longer."
 jgd_sindh_title: "Subdue the Heathens"
 jgd_sindh_desc: "All this time, the Sindhis were committing blasphemy whilst we were too weak to do anything. Now that we are capable of defeating nations the like of Gujarat, it is possible for us to stop the madness in Sindh."
 jgd_treasury_title: "Amass Wealth"
 jgd_treasury_desc: "Thanks to the lucrative trade in Gujarat, our economy is prospering. Our shares in the node provide vast sums of money that help fund our expansion and development. However, it is in our best interest to amass some wealth so that we can improve the conditions of trade and gain yet even more money."
 jgd_palitana_title: "Subjugate Palitana"
 jgd_palitana_desc: "Although Palitana was once an ally and brother of ours, they are now oppose and rival us. Whilst this may put us in jeopardy seeing as they directly border the Gujarati sultanate, it is imperative that we acquire this land before the sultans come knocking at our doorstep."
 jgd_attack_gujarat_title: "Tackle the Gujarati Threat"
 jgd_attack_gujarat_desc: "Now that we have united the majority of Saurashtra under our rule, it is time for us to address the looming threat of Gujarat. We are no longer weak and feeble and with the help of their rivals, we can manage to defeat the sultanate."
 jgd_defeat_gujarat_title: "Defeat Gujarat"
 jgd_defeat_gujarat_desc: "Finally, our worst fears shall be quelled. No longer shall Gujarat be a threatening sultanate but simply a weak nation, with little-to-no chance of ever troubling us again."
 jgd_mewar_title: "Betray Mewar"
 jgd_mewar_desc: "Although we once had diplomatic ties to the Sisodiyas, the time has come for us to conquer Mewar. We no longer have any use for them, and they simply are in the way of potential conquests in Nagaur and the fertile Doab."
 jgd_navy_title: "Expand the Navy"
 jgd_navy_desc: "Trade makes up a significant portion of our economy. However, our navy is currently lacking and are quite small. Let us expand our navy and become a regional naval power."
 jgd_trade_title: "Dominate Local Trade"

 jgd_alliances_title: "Rajput Diplomacy"
 jgd_alliances_desc: "Sooner or later, we will come face to face with the Gujarati sultans, and eventually we will meet them on the battlefield.

 jgd_malwa_title: "Expand into Malwa"

 jgd_finisher_desc: "The time has come to proclaim ourselves a new nation. No longer are we a petty princedom nestled within Saurashtra. We are now a growing kingdom, with domains ranging from Sindh to the Gondi Jungles. We can now proclaim ourselves a new state."

 prb_junagadh_title: "Seize Girnar"
 prb_junagadh_desc: "Mount Girnar is a holy site for Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists. Currently, it is controlled by the Chudasama dynasty, our sworn enemies. We can not allow for such an important site to be in enemy hands for any longer."
