 string_start_title_bishnupur: "The Mallas of Bishnupur"
 string_start_bishnupur: "Shrouded behind the jungles of §YGondwana§! and §YJharkhand§!, §YBishnupur§! remains relatively isolated and unaffected by the conflicts in Delhi and elsewhere. However, with recent incursions from the §YBengalis§! and an §YOrissa§! starting to expand under Kapilendra, §YBishnupur§! is in a precarious state.\n\n§YBishnupur§! must reform at an alarming rate and manage to unite the jungles of §YCentral India§! whilst balancing the ever-expanding §YOriya§! and §YBengali hegemonies§!, but with such a fragile economy, it may not be possible."

 string_start_title_pandya: "Pandya, a Fading Empire"
 string_start_pandya: "Ever since the invasions from the §YKhalji§! sultanate in the 14th century, the §YPandyan§! state has been a shadow of its former self, no longer controlling any of their historical capitals, restricted to §YTenkasi§! and §YRamanathapuram§!. The once rich and prosperous Tamil empire that rivaled that of the §YChola§! and §YHoysala§! in its heyday has been brought to its knees by the §YVijayanagari§!. The cultural centers of §YMadurai§! and §YKorkai§! and the trade with Arabia during the Sangam Age have been long lost and have almost completely faded from the minds of many. No longer are the §YPandya§! a Tamil trading empire, but simply a lowly princedom under threat by a larger, more powerful empire.\n\nIt will not be easy to restore the §YPandya§! empire, nor will it be to maintain the land that is currently controlled by the §YVijayanagari§!."
