 KND_ideas: "Kandyan Ideas"
 KND_ideas_start: "Kandyan Self-Reliance"
 KND_ideas_bonus: "Kandyan Prestige"
 KND_kandyan_terrain: "The Hills of Kandy"
 KND_kandyan_terrain_desc: "The terrain of our core is filled with heavily forested hills and mountains. Coupled with the monsoon season, our land is very easily defendable and opposition will have trouble sieging our lands."
 KND_temple_of_the_tooth: "Temple of the Tooth"
 KND_temple_of_the_tooth_desc: "Located in Kandy, the Temple of the Tooth holds the Buddha's left canine tooth. The tooth is significant as it is one of the top-tier relics of Theravada Buddhism, and our ownership of it gives great prestige to our nation. Moreover, it is said that the owner of the tooth is the leader of a unified Lanka, helping to legitimize our claims."
 KND_kandy_city: "Senkadagalapura"
 KND_kandy_city_desc: "For most of Lankan history, Kandy or Senkadagalapura was one of the largest cities on the island, only rivaled by Kotte and Jaffna. However, something that sets us apart is the religious significance of our city to Theravada Buddhism. Thousands from across East and Southeast Asia flock to Kandy every year, and some of our visitors could help improve our nation if utilizied well."
 KND_central_lankan_trade: "Lankan Trade"
 KND_central_lankan_trade_desc: "Our great and prosperous capital has been a center of trade in Lanka for centuries. Through our large coast in the east, traders from Malaya and Indochina come to trade goods. If we expand our trading economy, we could rival the Malabari and Vijayanagari trading monopolies."
 KND_kodithuwakkuwa: "Kodhithuwakkuwa"
 KND_kodithuwakkuwa_desc: "In the 18th century, the traditional bows and arrows of Kandyan combat became obsolete because of European muskets and artillery. As European technology reached our island, blacksmiths began improving these European weapons, allowing for better range and accuracy. From this, we developed kodhithuwakkuwa, a hand-held cannon. This will allow for us to mass produce artillery similar to the scale of European great powers."
 KND_the_last_independent_lankans: "The Last Independent Lankans"
 KND_the_last_independent_lankans_desc: "From our inception, Kandyans were fierce fighters and strived to maintain their independence. Whilst we did lose our coast, we managed to carry on until 1815 and survive multiple European invasions. Because of this, our armies have high morale knowing that in times of need, we will succeed."
 KND_holy_buddhist_site: "A Holy Site"
 KND_holy_buddhist_site_desc: "Kandy is one of the most important religious sites of our religion. As custodians of Kandy, we must ensure that it remains open to all Buddhists."
