 flavor_ori.3.t: "Kapilendra's Succession War"
 flavor_ori.3.d: "Whilst Kapilendra was a great conqueror who annexed vast swathes of land into his realm, his philandering eventually caught up to him. Over the course of his life, he would go on to father 18 children from both concubines and wives. The main two, Hamvira and Purushottama, were the most influential and relevant of the many sons and each had inherited their father's militarist genes. Hamvira was a general in the Oriya army and would lead grand expeditions in both the Bengali and Telugu fronts. Purushottama, on the other hand, would remain in Puri and become more and more influential until his father eventually designated him as the new heir. After the death of Kapilendra Deva, his heir and former heir, Purushottama and Hamvira, duked it out for the crown. Whilst Purushottama acceded to the throne, Hamvira was in arms over this and sparked a decade-long civil war. This civil war would destabilize the Oriya crown and never again would it be as powerful as it was under Kapilendra."
