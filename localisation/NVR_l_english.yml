 nvr_independence_title: "Achieve Independence"
 nvr_independence_desc: "For decades, we have been subservient to the Jams of Kutch and have been forced to accept their supremacy. This shall last for no longer, as we shall fight for our independence like the true Rajputs we are!"
 nvr_jethwas_title: "Quell the Jethwas"
 nvr_jethwas_desc: "The Jethwas of Porbandar are an inconvenience at most. Not only do they threaten our regional trade but they oppose us and have the audacity to call themselves our rivals. We can no longer allow this absurdity, as we must expand before the sultans of Ahmadabad surround us."
 nvr_jhalavad_title: "Conquer Jhalavad"
 nvr_jhalavad_desc: "Surrounded on many sides by larger, more powerful neighbors, the Rajputs of Jhalavad are in a precarious situation. If we do not manage to take these lands over in time, the Gujaratis to their north and east will strike."
 nvr_army_title: "Rajput Armies"
 nvr_army_desc: "As a Rajput state, armies are of great significance in our society. For this reason, it is ludicrous that our armies are as small as they are. Moreover, with many weaker states neighboring us and a looming threat in the Gujarati sultanate, it is in our best interests to assemble and maintain an army as large as possible."
 nvr_kutch_title: "The False Jadejas"
 nvr_kutch_desc: "Whilst our royal family descends from the same Jadeja Rajputs that rule Kutch, we can no longer associate ourselves with our oppressive former overlords. And no longer can we allow them to dominate the Rann and block us from further expansion. It is time we turn the tables on our former overlords, denounce them, and wipe them from the face of this Earth."
 nvr_sindh_title: "The Inferior Jam"
 nvr_sindh_desc: "The Samma and Jadeja Rajputs are among the few nations that refer to their leader as a Jam. As we have turned the tables on Kutch and have eliminated them, all that is left is the inferior Jam that is in control of Sindh. Furthermore, the heathenous Jam of Sindh continues to proselytize his land and pull his people away from the true faith. Only in Amarkot are the Hindus safe and if we do not do anything, they will be lost too."
 nvr_palitana_title: "Subjugate Palitana"
 nvr_palitana_desc: "Although Palitana was once an ally and brother of ours, they are now oppose and rival us. Whilst this may put us in jeopardy seeing as they directly border the Gujarati sultanate, it is imperative that we acquire this land before the sultans come knocking at our doorstep."
 nvr_attack_gujarat_title: "Tackle the Gujarati Threat"
 nvr_attack_gujarat_desc: "Now that we have united the majority of Saurashtra under our rule, it is time for us to address the looming threat of Gujarat. We are no longer weak and feeble and with the help of their rivals, we can manage to defeat the sultanate."
 nvr_defeat_gujarat_title: "Defeat Gujarat"
 nvr_defeat_gujarat_desc: "Finally, our worst fears shall be quelled. No longer shall Gujarat be a threatening sultanate but simply a weak nation, with little-to-no chance of ever troubling us again."
 nvr_mewar_title: "Betray Mewar"
 nvr_mewar_desc: "Although we once had diplomatic ties to the Sisodiyas, the time has come for us to conquer Mewar. We no longer have any use for them, and they simply are in the way of potential conquests in Nagaur and the fertile Doab."
 nvr_navy_title: "Expand the Navy"
 nvr_navy_desc: "Trade makes up a significant portion of our economy. However, our navy is currently lacking and are quite small. Let us expand our navy and become a regional naval power."
 nvr_trade_title: "Dominate Local Trade"
 nvr_trade_desc: "With our heavy reliance on trade, the more shares and power, the better. As this is true, we should strive to become the dominant trade power in our home region so our nation shall prosper even more."
 nvr_alliances_title: "Rajput Diplomacy"
 nvr_alliances_desc: "Sooner or later, we will come face to face with the Gujarati sultans, and eventually we will meet them on the battlefield. However, our strength alone is not nearly enough to combat them. If the enemy of your enemy is your friend, then we should form an alliance with Gujarat's rivals, preferrably the Sisodiya Rajputs."
 nvr_malwa_title: "Expand into Malwa"
 nvr_malwa_desc: "Deeper into Central India we find yet another troublesome sultanate - this time the Malvi. With our strength acquired from defeating Gujarat, we may now have the power to topple this sultanate that threatens our dynasty."
 nvr_finisher_title: "A Saurashtran Power"
 nvr_finisher_desc: "The time has come to proclaim ourselves a new nation. No longer are we a petty princedom nestled within Saurashtra. We are now a growing kingdom, with domains ranging from Sindh to the Gondi Jungles. We can now proclaim ourselves a new state."
 nvr_junagadh_title: "Seize Girnar"
 nvr_junagadh_desc: "Mount Girnar is a holy site for Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists. Currently, it is controlled by the Chudasama dynasty, our sworn enemies. We can not allow for such an important site to be in enemy hands for any longer."  
 nvr_islam_title: "The Path of Islam"
 nvr_islam_desc: "Whilst we have formally destroyed all ties we had with the Jadejas, we cannot deny how much of our culture is retained. For one, we have maintained the Hindu-Muslim syncretism that the Jadejas have adhered to for centuries. With the senior branch of the Jadejas, the Samma, already having converted to Islam years ago and the emigration of Muslim merchants to our ports, perhaps it is time for us to embrace Islamic ideals."
