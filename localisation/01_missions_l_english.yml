 jgd_uparkot_desc: "In the vicinity of our capital, Uparkot Fort gives us an advantage as it provides superior fortification to our capital.

#Khmer
 khm_religion_title: "Religion in Khmer"
 khm_religion_desc: "The Khmer homeland is extremely diverse in beliefs. Whilst some follow the ancient Hindu beliefs that we strayed away from hundreds of years ago, others in the highlands follow animistic beliefs. With our state religion being but a minority in our nation, perhaps we should embrace the religion of the majority."
 khm_develop_angkor_title: "Revitalize Yasodharapura"
 khm_develop_angkor_desc: "Yasodharapura, better known as Angkor, is a lost city. Once the bustling capital of the Khmer Empire, invasions and ecological events caused the city to be rapidly deserted as its inhabitants dispersed throughout our former empire. The temples are slowly being reclaimed by the vast jungles, the barays are eroding away at the city moat's walls,and the city is barely populated whatsoever. With the decline of Khmer coming to an end, we should revitalize the city and prevent these wondrous structures from being lost to time."
 khm_cambodian_centers_title: "The Khmer Centers"
 khm_cambodian_centers_desc: "Cambodia has many historical capitals. However, the two most significant ones are Chaktomuk, also know as Phnom Penh, and Yasodharapura, better known as Angkor Thom or 'Great City.' Both centers have deteriorated over the years because to Thai and Cham invaders and the extensive periods of national drought followed by mass flooding. With Angkor already being repopulated, we should expand the boundaries of the rich, fertile city of Chaktomuk."
 khm_develop_the_mekong_title: "Clear and Repurpose"
 khm_develop_the_mekong_desc: "The Mekong Delta is one of the most fertile regions of Asia. However, besides the great city of Chaktomuk, the rest is covered by uncleared jungles and extensive undeveloped regions. If we cleared the delta and started development projects, the delta would have the potential to produce large crop yields and feed the millions of people of our nation."
 khm_highland_infrastructure_title: "Highland Infrastructure"
 khm_highland_infrastructure_desc: "In part because of their isolated location and also because of the autonomous chieftains who reside there, the highlands of our nation between Kratie, Stung Treng, and Tay Nguyen have untapped potential. Kratie and Stung Treng, specifically, are right along the Mekong and could become regional hubs of trade. With the trade in the region already lacking and the chieftains autonomous as ever, we should populate and develop these areas."
 khm_build_armies_title: "End the Decline"
 khm_build_armies_desc: "Cambodia is in a dark age. The golden age of culture and the Khmer Empire has long since been gone. Incursions on all sides from the Thai, Lao, and even the Cham leave us encircled more and more. We must end this decline as soon as possible."
 khm_build_temples_title: "Renovate Old Temples"
 khm_build_temples_desc: "Cambodia was once home to a myriad of temples, the majority of which were located in just Angkor. But because of religious conflicts between Hindus and Buddhists, especially in the royal line as there were constantly Hindus being succeeded by Buddhists and vice versa, both sides kept defacing the opposing sides' temples. Centuries later, most of the temples of Cambodia are deteriorating rapidly and many have already been destroyed by the likes of the Thai. To truly end the decline of Khmer we must not only restore the armies, but the temples as well."
 khm_convert_champa_title: "Conversions in the East"
 khm_convert_champa_desc: "The highlands of Kratie, Champa, and Stung Treng are populated by tribal peoples. Besides the Ma, most of these people follow animistic beliefs and not our state religion. This, in turn, directly affects our religious unity. It is imperative to convert these peoples to maintain our religious unity."
 khm_build_marketplaces_title: "Reinstitute Marketplaces"
 khm_build_marketplaces_desc: "Angkor was once a bustling city filled with a grand marketplace, local workshops, many temples, and more. Since the golden age of our nation, however, not just Angkorian marketplaces are declining. Trade and commerce continue to decline and there are few continuously functioning marketplaces and workshops in our nation. With our nation once being filled with marketplaces, it is quite laughable that we have reverted to this age where marketplaces are but a rarity. Therefore, it is imperative we restore the marketplaces of Khmer."
 khm_build_cavalry_title: "Employ the Elephants"
 khm_build_cavalry_desc: "Elephants have always played an important role in our nation. They have been tamed and help those who own them farm and are better than oxen in regards to carrying heavy loads. But what if we something revolutionary? What if we use them in our armies?"
 khm_invade_champa_title: "Revenge for 1177"
 khm_invade_champa_desc: "Never forget 1177. The Cham sailed up the Mekong, seized control of Tonle Sap, and not only our glorious city of Angkor but killed our king at the time. It took the power of the great Jayavarman VII to fend off the Cham and kick them out on both land and sea. Fortunately, when we started to recede into a dark age, so did the Cham. Recent incursions by the reestablished Vietnamese state and the increasingly autonomous Degars have caused the Cham to be locked to the coast around Vijaya, Panduranga, and Kauthara. Sooner or later, they'll fall to the Vietnamese if we don't take action."
 khm_naval_might_title: "Imperial Khmer Navy"
 khm_naval_might_desc: "We have many naval ambitions, but with enemies on all sides for so long, we faced and lost many naval conflicts. Nevertheless, we have managed to maintain our naval traditions and sustain a sizable navy. However, our navy is still lacking and does not stand a chance to the likes of Malaya or China. We have been navally lacking long enough, we should reform our navy and establish the Imperial Khmer Navy."
 khm_expand_into_khorat_title: "Liberate Khorat"
 khm_expand_into_khorat_desc: "Most of the Khorat region is filled with our brethren, people groups similar to the Khmer but under a different banner, mostly the Lao. The Lao, however, are not remotely the same as the Khmer and fail to treat these people groups correctly. Let us liberate our brethren in Khorat and save them from the oppressive foreign leadership they withstand." 
 khm_conquer_south_laos_title: "Incursions into South Laos"
 khm_conquer_south_laos_desc: "The Lao foolishly leave South Laos relatively undefended, believing that the harsh terrain allows for guerilla warfare to deter the threat any foreign invaders. However, they severely underestimate the might of Khmer, and their mistakes allow it to not be too hard to seize these lands."
 khm_north_laos_title: "Menace of the North"
 khm_north_laos_desc: "Our northern borders have for too long been terrorized by the kingdom of Lan Xang Hom Khao. For too long have the brethren of the Khmer been oppressed whilst subject to Luang Prabang. For too long has this menace in the north been allowed to live!"
 khm_end_vietnam_title: "Eliminate Vietnam"
 khm_end_vietnam_desc: "The restored Vietnamese state after the Fourth Chinese Domination of Vietnam has managed quite nicely, making advancements militarily in both Xiangkhouang in Laos and in Indrapura in Champa. Regardless, they have been allowed to dominate regional trade for far too long, and threaten our monopoly on trade in Indochina. We should eliminate this trading rival before China comes and intervenes again,"
 khm_be_free_title: "End Chinese Supremacism"
 khm_be_free_desc: "For almost a millenium, Cambodia has been forced to submit to China, and to multiple dynasties, including the Song, Yuan, and Ming. No longer will we forcefully give tribute to the Chinese emperors for little benefit. No longer shall we suffer being forced to submit to China. We are strong, and China will continue to bring us down henceforth."
 khm_finisher_title: "The Second Khmer Empire"
 khm_finisher_desc: "The Second Golden Age of the Khmer Empire is upon us! Just a few centuries ago, we were in a golden age of art, culture, literature, and religion. Then, disaster struck as foreign invasions coupled with ecological changes forced our great capital Angkor to be deserted and our nation into a dark age. In just a few decades, we have managed to revert the decline and have ushered in another golden age for the Khmer empire."
 khm_reconquer_battambang_title: "Reconquer Battambang"
 khm_reconquer_battambang_desc: "Battambang has been a hub of Cambodian trade since the 11th century, and was never lost to the Thai. However, the peoples of Paradox have placed our lands in enemy hands with a lack of historical basis. In fact, we controlled up to Srah Kaev. We should fix this blunder immediately."
 khm_revenge_ayutthaya_title: "Sack Ayutthaya"
 khm_revenge_ayutthaya_desc: "In 1431, the Thai armies sacked our beautiful city of Angkor. Thousands were slaughtered and many were forced to flee to cities like Chaktomuk, Oudong, or even far-off places like Laos or the highlands. We must seek vengeance for the atrocities that the Thai commited to our nation."
 khm_conquer_central_thailand_title: "End the Thai Domination"
 khm_conquer_central_thailand_desc: "Because of the power gap left by the end of the golden age of the Khmer Empire, Ayutthaya managed to expand quickly and has grown into a threatening state. Since then, they have managed to become king of both Ayutthaya and Sukhothai, and even have expanded their reach down into Tenasserim and east into Khorat. However, the dark age of Cambodia has ended, and we are now capable of ending the power struggle in Indochina where the Thai have the upper hand."
 khm_conquer_northern_thailand_title: "Restore Haripunchai"
 khm_conquer_northern_thailand_desc: "Haripunchai was a Mon state centered around Lamphun, also known as Haripunchai, in Northern Thailand. However, in 1292 the kingdom was conquered by Mangrai, who later founded Chiang Mai and established the kingdom of Lan Na. Since then, Mon influence in the region has faded as the ethnically Thai Lanna kingdom dominates the region. As Mon is a relative of Khmer, it would be in our interests to restore Mon-Khmer influence in Northern Thailand. Perhaps if we installed Harinpunchai as a puppet we could propagate Mon culture in Lanna once more and also block our nation off from the autonomous Saophas."

 lxa_shan_desc: "The Shan states are as disunited as the jungles of India. Each and every independent state is one area not subject to us that could be. We can not let this last any longer though, so let us conquer the Shan states."
 lxa_pegu_title: "Hanthawaddy Pegu"
 lxa_pegu_desc: "Pegu is a center of trade and of Mon culture in Burma. However, with both the Arakani pirates and the Thai at their doorstep, they are bound to be attacked eventually. Instead, we can take them for ourselves and let no other nation get access to these valuable trade centers."
 lxa_follow_irrawaddy_title: "Follow the Irrawaddy"
 lxa_follow_irrawaddy_desc: "If we follow the Irrawaddy from Pegu, we reach into the centers of Taungoo, the remnants of Bagan, and Ava lands. If it means eliminating more troublesome Saophas and also attacking the source, then we should expand into Central Burma."
 lxa_ava_title: "Center of Burma"
 lxa_ava_desc: "The center of the entirety of Burma is in Ava. At the end of the day, all of the troublesome Saophas that we once had to deal with submit to Ava. For no longer, however, as we shall conquer this beloved city and bring the Saophas to our feet instead."
 lxa_burma_united_title: "Burma United!"
 lxa_burma_united_desc: "What remains of Burma is either miniscule and obscure or under our crown's control. However, if we want to be masters of Burma, it all has to be completely under our rule."
 lxa_lanna_title: "Eliminate Lan Na"
 lxa_lanna_desc: "Lan Na under Tilokaracha has been extremely troublesome. It is astonishing how he has managed to unite so many lands in such a short amount of time and threatens even the Thai down south. However, they have never faced a nation as mighty as us, and they shall fall under us too." 
 lxa_khorat_title: "Unite Khorat"
 lxa_khorat_desc: "Whilst the majority of the Khorat region is already under our control, some settlements are still under enemy control. As we already expect to be invading the Thai soon, it is in our interest to start by uniting Khorat."
 lxa_ayutthaya_title: "Eclipse Ayutthaya"
 lxa_ayutthaya_desc: "The time has come for us to eclipse Ayutthaya. Surrounded by us in three fronts and having faced defeat by our hands before, they are weaker than ever. No longer shall the Thai threaten our crown or our people!"
 lxa_angkor_wat_title: "Restore Angkor Wat"
 lxa_angkor_wat_desc: "Angkor Wat was once a great temple and the center of the Khmer court. However, through centuries of warfare and uncontrollable flooding, the city has almost been deserted and reclaimed by the surrounding jungles. It doesn't help that it has been sacked by both the Cham and the Thai, nor that it experienced a mass emigration. Now that it is under our control, we must restore Angkor Wat to its former glory and beyond."
 lxa_xiangtaeng_title: "Annex Xiang Taeng"
 lxa_xiangtaeng_desc: "Xiang Taeng, also known as Stung Treng to the Khmer, has been a center of Lao culture in Cambodia for almost a century. Thus, it is quite unfathomable as to why it is under control of the dying empire that is the Khmer. For no longer shall we allow the Lao of Xiang Taeng to be under enemy occupation."
 lxa_mekong_title: "The Mekong Delta"
 lxa_mekong_desc: "At the tip of Cambodia is the Hindu-populated Mekong Delta, a crucial center of both trade and commerce in Indochina. The large city of Chaktomuk in the Mekong Delta was the last center of the Khmer Empire and rivals both Ha Noi and Ayutthaya in population. We should conquer these lands and expand in both trade and size."
 lxa_cavalry_title: "Utilize the Cavalry"
 lxa_cavalry_desc: "With our official name, Lan Xang Hom Khao, meaning 'Land of A Million Elephants and White Parasols', it is quite laughable that our cavalry is as lacking as it is. If we want to truly live up to our name, we have to ensure that a significant portion of our army comprises of cavalry."
 lxa_cambodia_title: "Follow the Mekong"
 lxa_cambodia_desc: "The Khmer Empire is a dying state. The remnants of what was once a great empire now struggles to survive against Thai and Cham incursions. With our conquest of Xiang Taeng, Cambodia is open and undefended against our conquests. It would not be hard to conquer what's left of Cambodia by this point."
 lxa_tonkin_title: "Around the Mountains"
 lxa_tonkin_desc: "For ages, the Tonkin area of Central Vietnam has been nearly unreachable mainly because of the Annamite mountains. However, now that we have conquered the Red River Delta, Tonkin lays open and undefended against our might. Now that we have found a solution to our problem, we can simply expand south from the core of Vietnam."
 lxa_finisher_title: "Fa Ngum's Legacy"
 lxa_finisher_desc: "Fa Ngum was the great founder of Lan Xang. He managed to fight against the odds and united the Laotian lands under his banner. As his true successors we managed to expand his kingdom into a great empire like no other. Lan Xang Hom Khao is now a great power."
 lxa_sipsongchautai_title: "Sip Song Chau Tai"
 lxa_sipsongchautai_desc: "Right across our border with Dai Viet lies the area of Sipsongchautai, filled with minor Tai tribes subjugated under Vietnamese rule. The Tai people are like our brethren, they speak a similar language and share aspects of our culture. The fact that some foreign Vietnamese invaders own these lands is intolerable, so we should save our brothers in Sipsongchautai."
 lxa_redriverdelta_title: "Advance to the Delta"
 lxa_redriverdelta_desc: "The Red River Delta of Vietnam is one of the most densely populated regions in Indochina. Full of many of our rivals' peoples and the home of the Vietnamese court, it is a prime target for eastward expansion. Perhaps if we subjugated this region we could reap significant benefits."
 lxa_champa_title: "Finish off Champa"
 lxa_champa_desc: "Like the Khmer down south, Champa is also a dying state facing annexation by an enemy state - this time the Vietnamese. Instead of giving our rivals a chance to expand, let us finish off this sad state and rid them of their misery."
 lxa_develop_songhong_title: "Develop the Delta"
 lxa_develop_songhong_desc: "The Red River Delta is fertile and has a lot of potential if handled correctly. However, many lands in the Delta are jungle and are left as is. This should be changed, as there are far more benefits of having developed cities in the delta over having useless jungle."
 lxa_mountainpasses_title: "Traversing the Mountains"
 lxa_mountainpasses_desc: "The Annamite Mountains prove hard to cross through and are troublesome as they force us to either travel through harsh terrain or go around it. However, the discovery of a new passage has allowed for faster travel. Let us promote and develop this mountain pass to increase the speed and amount of travel between Laos and Vietnam."

 nvr_jethwas_title: "Quell the Jethwas"
 nvr_jethwas_desc: "The Jethwas of Porbandar are an inconvenience at most. Not only do they threaten our regional trade but they oppose us and have the audacity to call themselves our rivals. We can no longer allow this absurdity, as we must expand before the sultans of Ahmadabad surround us."
 nvr_jhalavad_title: "Conquer Jhalavad"
 nvr_jhalavad_desc: "Surrounded on many sides by larger, more powerful neighbors, the Rajputs of Jhalavad are in a precarious situation. If we do not manage to take these lands over in time, the Gujaratis to their north and east will strike."
 nvr_army_title: "Rajput Armies"
 nvr_army_desc: "As a Rajput state, armies are of great significance in our society. For this reason, it is ludicrous that our armies are as small as they are. Moreover, with many weaker states neighboring us and a looming threat in the Gujarati sultanate, it is in our best interests to assemble and maintain an army as large as possible."
 nvr_kutch_title: "The False Jadejas"
 nvr_kutch_desc: "Whilst our royal family descends from the same Jadeja Rajputs that rule Kutch, we can no longer associate ourselves with our oppressive former overlords. And no longer can we allow them to dominate the Rann and block us from further expansion. It is time we turn the tables on our former overlords, denounce them, and wipe them from the face of this Earth."
 nvr_sindh_title: "The Inferior Jam"
 nvr_sindh_desc: "The Samma and Jadeja Rajputs are among the few nations that refer to their leader as a Jam. As we have turned the tables on Kutch and have eliminated them, all that is left is the inferior Jam that is in control of Sindh. Furthermore, the heathenous Jam of Sindh continues to proselytize his land and pull his people away from the true faith. Only in Amarkot are the Hindus safe and if we do not do anything, they will be lost too."
 nvr_palitana_title: "Subjugate Palitana"
 nvr_palitana_desc: "Although Palitana was once an ally and brother of ours, they are now oppose and rival us. Whilst this may put us in jeopardy seeing as they directly border the Gujarati sultanate, it is imperative that we acquire this land before the sultans come knocking at our doorstep."
 nvr_attack_gujarat_title: "Tackle the Gujarati Threat"

 nvr_defeat_gujarat_title: "Defeat Gujarat"

 nvr_mewar_title: "Betray Mewar"
 nvr_mewar_desc: "Although we once had diplomatic ties to the Sisodiyas, the time has come for us to conquer Mewar. We no longer have any use for them, and they simply are in the way of potential conquests in Nagaur and the fertile Doab."

 nvr_alliances_title: "Rajput Diplomacy"
 nvr_alliances_desc: "Sooner or later, we will come face to face with the Gujarati sultans, and eventually we will meet them on the battlefield. However, our strength alone is not nearly enough to combat them. If the enemy of your enemy is your friend, then we should form an alliance with Gujarat's rivals, preferrably the Sisodiya Rajputs."
 nvr_malwa_title: "Expand into Malwa"
 nvr_malwa_desc: "Deeper into Central India we find yet another troublesome sultanate - this time the Malvi. With our strength acquired from defeating Gujarat, we may now have the power to topple this sultanate that threatens our dynasty."
 nvr_finisher_title: "A Saurashtran Power"
 nvr_finisher_desc: "The time has come to proclaim ourselves a new nation. No longer are we a petty princedom nestled within Saurashtra. We are now a growing kingdom, with domains ranging from Sindh to the Gondi Jungles. We can now proclaim ourselves a new state."
 nvr_junagadh_title: "Seize Girnar"
 nvr_junagadh_desc: "Mount Girnar is a holy site for Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists. Currently, it is controlled by the Chudasama dynasty, our sworn enemies. We can not allow for such an important site to be in enemy hands for any longer."  
 nvr_islam_title: "The Path of Islam"
 nvr_islam_desc: "Whilst we have formally destroyed all ties we had with the Jadejas, we cannot deny how much of our culture is retained. For one, we have maintained the Hindu-Muslim syncretism that the Jadejas have adhered to for centuries. With the senior branch of the Jadejas, the Samma, already having converted to Islam years ago and the emigration of Muslim merchants to our ports, perhaps it is time for us to embrace Islamic ideals."

 ori_garjati_fealty_desc: "Inland from the Oriya coast, we have multiple vassals in Garjat, Jeypore, Parlakhimidi, and Keonjhar. However, maintaining so many vassals is tedious and tiresome. With our king's many sons, we could unite them and put a son as head."
 ori_cultural_acceptance_title: "Cultural Acceptance" 
 ori_cultural_acceptance_desc: "While we may enlighten some in the Oriya way of life, it is not humane to change peoples' cultures. Instead, we should acknowledge their culture and allow for them to freely observe their own heritage."
 ori_mahanadi_title: "Up the Mahanadi"

 ori_halt_islam_title: "Halt Islamic Advances"
 ori_halt_islam_desc: "As custodians of the Hindu faith, it is unfathomable that our home region is subjugated by Muslim rule.

 ori_religion_title: "A United Religion"
 ori_religion_desc: "As it stands, Hinduism is a religion losing ground all throughout Asia. However, with Orissa in the picture, this could change. If we keep the Hindu lands under our rule and maintain a state religion, Hinduism will prosper once more."
 ori_navy_title: "Build a Grand Navy"
 ori_navy_desc: "Our naval power has deteriorated over the years. No longer can we rival the Vijayanagari or Bengali navies, but we simply remain a minor naval power. But with every great nation comes a great navy, so we should build the grandest navy in all the land."

 ori_bastar_desc: "Within the Gond and Garjati-ridden jungles of Central India lie many minor duchies and kingdoms. Out of these the states of Kanker and Bastar are weak and face invasion from the Bahmanids if we don't take action. Therefore, we should annex this region to extend our reach and block off the Bahmanids."
 ori_jharkhand_title: "Into Jharkhand"
 ori_jharkhand_desc: "Jharkhand straddles across the borders of three growing powers in India. This puts that a precarious position, in that anyone who invades will become closer to the other two. However, there is nobody who can outmatch us, and we should break the stalemate and expand into Jharkhand." 
 ori_koch_title: "Acquire Koch"
 ori_koch_desc: "Up the Brahmaputra lies more of Bengal and Kochi land. As a means of expanding our reach along the Brahmaputra, we should take over Koch and use the river for trade and defense."
 ori_develop_bengal_title: "Develop Bengal"
 ori_develop_bengal_desc: "The vast jungles of the Bengali Delta prevent much in the form of development and expansion. However, if we cleared parts of the delta and develop it, we may be able to increase our trade exponentially."
 ori_bengali_textiles_title: "Bengali Textiles"
 ori_bengali_textiles_desc: "Textiles have been the backbone for Bengali trade and economic output for centuries. Therefore, as the owners of Bengal, it is only fitting to expand this industry through manufactories."
 ori_andamans_title: "Colonize the Andamans"
 ori_andamans_desc: "Not far from Orissa or Bengal lies the Andaman Islands. Relatively isolated and aggressive to invaders, nobody has attempted to colonize the usland yet. However, with its central location between Bengal and Sumatra, it could be a great docking point and a way to better supply our Indonesian conquests."
 ori_elephants_title: "Oriya Elephants"
 ori_elephants_desc: "In Oriya, Gajapati means 'master of the elephants.' Therefore, it is unfitting that we do not comprise our army of at least 33% cavalry. We should seek to fix this, and add cavalry to our armies."
 ori_mallabhum_title: "Subjugate Mallabhum"

 ori_bengal_title: "Bengali Expansion"
 ori_bengal_desc: "Right next to our border is the troublesome fort of Satgaon, which Bengal maintains in order to hold us off. With our strength, however, the Bengali are mere weaklings.

 ori_gaur_title: "Onward to Gauda"
 ori_gaur_desc: "Gauda is the prized center of the once-greater Bengali crown, but since they have lost to us Gauda has had less power over the region. Nevertheless, it is still a great conquest, and thus we should expand our reach to Gauda." 
 ori_arakan_title: "Seize the Arakani Coast"
 ori_arakan_desc: "Arakani piracy is notorious throughout coastal nations in their vicinity. These pirates threaten our trade and increasingly become more and more troublesome. Perhaps if we target them at their source, they will cease to be a threat to us."

 ori_succession_title: "Kapilendra's Succession"
 ori_succession_desc: "With Kapilendra's many sons, a potential succession war could erupt if we do not have a legitimate king to succeed Kapilendra. Thus, on his death, we should seek to prevent any doubt and continue the crown under a stable heir."
 ori_culture_title: "Spread Oriya Culture"
 ori_culture_desc: "As we expand more and more, the Oriya culture becomes a minority in our territory. Sooner or later, Oriya culture will become obsolete as more and more of our land comprises of Bengali, Telugu, or Gond-Garjat people. We should teach them the Oriya way of life and maintain our culture for years to come."
 ori_oriya_title: "A Growing Culture"
 ori_oriya_desc: "With our intentions of teaching people the ways of the Oriya crown, people have learned to accept our culture and turn it into their own. Once we educate a sizable amount of people, then we will know that Oriya culture shall flourish henceforth."

 ori_berar_title: "Invade Berar"
 ori_berar_desc: "With the incursions we have made into Deccani territory, we have set our sight on the Berar area which. This area is near the growing Malvi sultanate and also brings us closer to the Gond and Garjat tribes that haven't accepted our rule. We should take over Berar to expand our reach and weaken our enemies even further."
 ori_bidar_title: "Advance to Bidar"
 ori_bidar_desc: "Finally, after years of conquest and war, we close in near Bidar, the prized city of the Bahmanids. By now, they are but a shadow of their former self, no longer being able to rival Orissa at all. Let us take Bidar and quell the Bahmani flame once and for all!"
 ori_three_capitals_title: "The Three Capitals"
 ori_three_capitals_desc: "Three great cities, Bidar, Vijayanagar, and Gauda, lie in our hands, each once a capital of a great nation. But now, the only great nation is Orissa, and Orissa only. What are we to do with these three cities that rival our capital? Let us choose."

 ori_education_title: "Educating the Population"
 ori_education_desc: "Our population is very uneducated and this has caused us to lack behind in technology compared to the more advanced Europeans. We can change this, however, by promoting the building of universities and potentially changing our education system."
 ori_barabati_title: "Restore Barabati Fort"
 ori_barabati_desc: "In Cuttack, there once was a great fort known as Barabati fort. But as time passed, the fort decayed and has been in ruins. As the custodians of Cuttack, it is our duty to restore the fort and defend our capital."
 ori_defend_jungle_title: "Defend the Jungle"

 ori_andhra_title: "Conquer the Reddi Kingdom"
 ori_andhra_desc: "The Reddi Nayaks of Rajahmundry have the audacity to ally our enemies and claim to rival our state. However, the fact that they need to ally the Vijayanagari for protection proves their weakness. In order to eliminate opposition and to get closer to our true enemies, we should wipe the Rajahmundry Nayaks off the face of the earth." 
 ori_kaveri_title: "To Tanjore"
 ori_kaveri_desc: "After annexing the Rajahmundry Reddis, we have directly come into contact with the Vijayanagari. With their large navy and swathes of south Indian land, we should seek to eliminate them. The first thing we could do is to conquer their coast down to Tanjore."

 ori_city_of_victory_desc: "With the loss of the Carnatic coast, Vijayanagar has seen better days. On the other hand, our empire is prospering as we continue to expand and establish a new empire.

 prb_trade_title: "Dominate Local Trade"
 prb_trade_desc: "With our heavy reliance on trade, the more shares and power, the better. As this is true, we should strive to become the dominant trade power in our home region so our nation shall prosper even more."
 prb_alliances_title: "Rajput Diplomacy"
 prb_alliances_desc: "Sooner or later, we will come face to face with the Gujarati sultans, and eventually we will meet them on the battlefield. However, our strength alone is not nearly enough to combat them. If the enemy of your enemy is your friend, then we should form an alliance with Gujarat's rivals, preferrably the Sisodiya Rajputs."
 prb_malwa_title: "Expand into Malwa"
 prb_malwa_desc: "Deeper into Central India we find yet another troublesome sultanate - this time the Malvi. With our strength acquired from defeating Gujarat, we may now have the power to topple this sultanate that threatens our dynasty."
 prb_finisher_title: "A Saurashtran Power"
 prb_finisher_desc: "The time has come to proclaim ourselves a new nation. No longer are we a petty princedom nestled within Saurashtra. We are now a growing kingdom, with domains ranging from Sindh to the Gondi Jungles. We can now proclaim ourselves a new state."
 prb_junagadh_title: "Seize Girnar"
 prb_junagadh_desc: "Mount Girnar is a holy site for Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists. Currently, it is controlled by the Chudasama dynasty, our sworn enemies. We can not allow for such an important site to be in enemy hands for any longer."

 rjk_independence_title: "Achieve Independence"
 rjk_independence_desc: "For generations upon generations, we have been subservient to Kutch and subject to oppression from our overlords. No longer shall we be subject to this treachery. We will achieve our independence and proclaim ourselves as a new nation!"
 rjk_junagadh_title: "Subdue Girnar"
 rjk_junagadh_desc: "The Chudasama Rajputs to our south have placed their court in close proximity to the holy Mount Girnar. With the prestigious outlook on a nation in control of such a significant holy site, we should seek to seize Mount Girnar for ourselves and elevate our status and become exalted among others."  
 rjk_jethwas_title: "Seize Porbandar"
 rjk_jethwas_desc: "The key port of Porbandar on the coast of the Saurashtrian coast has been under Jethwa rule for centuries. Since most of our core is locked in the central, landlocked part of Saurashtra, our naval and trade ambitions may never come to fruition. We should change this by seizing the port and establishing maritime trade."
 rjk_jhalavad_title: "Conquer Jhalavad"
 rjk_jhalavad_desc: "The small princedom of Jhalavad lives in a precarious state, with a constant threat of Gujarati invasion. Sooner or later, we expect the Gujarati to strike and attempt to extend their reach even farther into Saurashtra. We cannot allow for them to grow any stronger, or our newly achieved independence will be at stake. Clearly, we should strike first and prevent any Gujarati incursions into our homeland."
 rjk_army_title: "Rajput Armies"
 rjk_army_desc: "With our Rajput warrior culture dominating our way of life, it is extremely counterintuitive and simply ludicrous that our armies are this disorganized. As a Rajput state, armies are of great significance in our society and are no laughing matter. With many weaker states neighboring us and a looming threat in the Gujarati sultanate, it is in our best interests to assemble an army as large as possible."
 rjk_kutch_title: "Turn the Tables"
 rjk_kutch_desc: "Once our former overlords, the land of Kutch week and feeble since our secession from their realm. They also share a long border with Gujarati sultanate which they has had numerous scuffles with and with their relatives, the Samma, in the north. Moreover, the royal family, the Jadejas, have always adhered to a heathenous syncretism between Hinduism and Islam, which is simply intolerable. It has also come to our attention that the Great Rann of Kutch has harsh terrain and would be a strategically defendable location in battle. We must turn the tables on our former overlords and subdue all of Kutch. They shall reign for no longer!"
 rjk_sindh_title: "Heart of the Indus"
 rjk_sindh_desc: "The mighty Indus river, the backbone of the fertile farmlands of Punjab and a river that has prevented many empires from advancing further, is completely ruled over by heathens. Centuries ago, the Samma Rajputs of Sindh had converted to Islam and has proselytized the people of Sindh away from the true faith. No longer shall we tolerate their blasphemous actions. It is time we eliminate the Samma Rajputs, stop this madness, and bring the Sindhi back to the true faith."
 rjk_palitana_title: "Subjugate Palitana"
 rjk_palitana_desc: "Once a major center of Jain religion and trade, Palitana has been reduced to a small princely state ruled by the Gohils who face invasion from the Gujarati sultanate. If we wish to unite Saurashtra and block any further Gujarati advances, Palitana is a crucial hub of trade which would allow us to dominate Saurashtrian trade even more."
 rjk_attack_gujarat_title: "Tackle the Gujarati Threat"
 rjk_attack_gujarat_desc: "Now that we have united the majority of Saurashtra under our rule, it is time for us to address the looming threat of Gujarat. We are no longer weak and feeble and with the help of their rivals, we can manage to defeat the sultanate."
 rjk_defeat_gujarat_title: "End Gujarati Supremacy"
 rjk_defeat_gujarat_desc: "Since its inception, the Gujarati sultanate has dominated our homeland in the Saurashtrian peninsula and has threatened our independence. This shall last for no longer. We must rise to arms, seize Ahmadabad, and end the Gujarati domination in Saurashtra once and for all!"
 rjk_mewar_title: "Betray Mewar"
 rjk_mewar_desc: "The Sisodiyas have always been our friends in battle and have helped us tremendously over the years. Nevertheless, we no longer have any use for them and they instead are simply in the way of further expansion into the fertile Doab. We must abandon our former allies and subjugate them so that we may continue our expansion into Rajputana."
 rjk_navy_title: "A Rajput Navy"
 rjk_navy_desc: "As we find ourselves no longer landlocked, we have been opened to the lucrative Arabian Sea trade. However, our lack of ships still limits us as we have few trade ships to exercise. Therefore, if we wish to expand our role in the Arabian sea trade, it is imperative we construct a grand navy to do so."
 rjk_trade_title: "Gujarati Trade Hegemony"
 rjk_trade_desc: "Thanks to our location on a peninsula jutting into the Arabian Sea, our Rajput warrior culture has developed into a mercantile one as well with a heavy reliance on trade. However, we currently hold miniscule shares within the lucrative Arabian Sea enterprise and are locked from the vast sums of wealth that this trade yields. If we truly want to become a prosperous society with a balance between military and maritime might, we must dominate the regional trade in Gujarat so that we may later extend our reach even farther beyond."
 rjk_alliances_title: "Rajput Diplomacy"
 rjk_alliances_desc: "As a recently established state, we are in dire need of diplomatic alliances if we wish to remain independent. Moreover, sooner or later we will inevitably have to come face to face with the Gujarati sultans, and eventually we will meet them on the battlefield. However, our military strength pales in comparison to theirs and we are in no shape to combat them alone. Seeing as the enemy of your enemy is your friend, we should establish diplomatic relations with the enemies of Gujarat."
 rjk_malwa_title: "Expand into Malwa"
 rjk_malwa_desc: "For centuries now, our continent has been plagued by sultanates that have established themselves taking advantage of the power gap left by the decline of the Delhian sultanate. Whilst we have managed to subdue the Gujarati sultanate, not far away deeper into the Deccan we find yet another troublesome sultanate—this time the Malvi. With our strength acquired from defeating Gujarat and our trusty allies, however, we may now have the power to topple this sultanate that threatens our dynasty."
 rjk_finisher_title: "From Humble Beginnings"
 rjk_finisher_desc: "Just some years ago, we were a vulnerable petty princedom that had recently declared independence from Kutch. From these humble beginnings, we have conquered swathes of land and can proclaim ourselves a new nation—the kingdom of the Saurashtrans. "
 rjk_islam_title: "Follow the Sindhi"
 rjk_islam_desc: "Both the Jadeja Rajput dynasty and its senior branch, the Samma, have a long history of Islamic influences. Whilst the Samma have fully embraced Islam, our royal family has maintained its Hindu-Muslim syncretism. With the steady conversion of the subcontinent to Islam and the influx of Arab and Muslim merchants, perhaps it may be in our interest to follow suit."
