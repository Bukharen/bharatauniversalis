 gujarati_nation_title: "Reunite Gujarat"
 gujarati_nation_desc: "Since the times of the Delhi sultanate, Gujarat has been divided into small petty princedoms, Rajput states, and larger Muslim sultanates. For centuries, Gujarat has been disunited with the peninsula being dominated by the much more powerful sultanates. Resolve this imbalance of power and unite the many princedoms into one united Gujarati kingdom."
