 filipino_nation_title: "Unite the Philippines"
 filipino_nation_desc: "The Filipino archipelago has never seen a day where all its people lived under a single banner. For centuries, competing Rajahnates, tribes, and plutocracies have vied for control over islands, whilst all the islands saw a shift from Hindu-Buddhist syncretism to Islam and other foreign beliefs. By uniting the Philippines, the stability it never had will finally come to be."
 hawaiian_nation_title: "Unification of Hawai'i"
 hawaiian_nation_desc: "For centuries, the vast Hawai'ian archipelago has been divided amongst minor Ali'i and has never seen a day of unity. This has been the case for far too long. It is now time to reform these islands and unite them under a single banner."
 wabanaki_nation_title: "Wabanaki Confederacy"
 wabanaki_nation_desc: "The tribes of Wabanahkik, or the Dawnland, have long been divided amongst squabbling chieftains who never seem to get along; there has not once been a day where there was no animosity between any two tribes. We can no longer allow for our peoples, who are all the same at heart, to suffer. By uniting the tribes of Wabanahkik, peace and order can be restored."
